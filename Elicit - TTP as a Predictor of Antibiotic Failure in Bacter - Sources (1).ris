AB  - OBJECTIVES

Studies examining time to positivity (TTP) of blood cultures as a risk
factor for death have shown conflicting results. The study objective
was to examine the effect of TTP on all-cause-30-day case-fatality
among a population-based cohort of patients with bloodstream
infections (BSI).

METHODS

A retrospective cohort study including all residents of Queensland,
Australia with incident monomicrobial BSI managed in the publicly
funded healthcare system from 2000 to 2019 was performed. Clinical,
TTP and all-cause 30-day case-fatality information was obtained from
state-wide sources.

RESULTS

A cohort of 88 314 patients was assembled. The median TTP was
14 hours, with 5th, 25th, 75th, and 95th percentiles of 4, 10, 20, and
53 hours, respectively. The TTP varied significantly by BSI aetiology.
The 30-day all-cause case-fatality rate was 2606/17 879 (14.6%),
2834/24 272 (11.7%), 2378/20 359 (11.7%), and 2752/22 431 (12.3%)
within the first, second, third, and fourth TTP quartiles,
respectively (p < 0.0001). After adjustment for age, sex, onset,
comorbidity, and focus of infection, TTP within 10 hours (first
quartile) was associated with a significantly increased risk for death
(odds ratio 1.43; 95% CI, 1.35-1.50; p < 0.001). After adjustment for
confounding variables (odds ratio; 95% CI), TTP within the first
quartile for Staphylococcus aureus (1.56; 1.41-1.73), Streptococcus
pneumoniae (1.91; 1.49-2.46), β-hemolytic streptococci (1.23;
1.00-1.50), Pseudomonas species (2.23; 1.85-2.69), Escherichia coli
(1.37; 1.23-1.53), Enterobacterales (1.38; 1.16-1.63), other
Gram-negatives (1.68; 1.36-2.06), and anaerobes (1.58; 1.28-1.94)
increased the risk for case-fatality.

DISCUSSION

This population-based analysis provides evidence that TTP is an
important determinant of mortality among patients with BSI.

AB  - ABSTRACT Few studies have assessed the time to blood culture
positivity as a predictor of clinical outcome in bloodstream
infections (BSIs). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the time
to positivity (TTP) of blood cultures in patients with Staphylococcus
aureus BSIs and to assess its impact on clinical outcome. We performed
a historical cohort study with 91 adult patients with S. aureus BSIs.
TTP was defined as the time between the start of incubation and the
time that the automated alert signal indicating growth in the culture
bottle sounded. Patients with BSIs and TTPs of culture of ≤12 h (n =
44) and >12 h (n = 47) were compared. Septic shock occurred in 13.6%
of patients with TTPs of ≤12 h and in 8.5% of patients with TTP of >12
h (P = 0.51). A central venous catheter source was more common with a
BSI TTP of ≤12 h (P = 0.010). Univariate analysis revealed that a
Charlson score of ≥3, the failure of at least one organ (respiratory,
cardiovascular, renal, hematologic, or hepatic), infection with
methicillin-resistant S. aureus, and TTPs of ≤12 h were associated
with death. Age, gender, an APACHE II score of ≥20 at BSI onset,
inadequate empirical antibiotic therapy, hospital-acquired bacteremia,
and endocarditis were not associated with mortality. Multivariate
analysis revealed that independent predictors of hospital mortality
were a Charlson score of ≥3 (odds ratio [OR], 14.4; 95% confidence
interval [CI], 2.24 to 92.55), infection with methicillin-resistant S.
aureus (OR, 9.3; 95% CI, 1.45 to 59.23), and TTPs of ≤12 h (OR, 6.9;
95% CI, 1.07 to 44.66). In this historical cohort study of BSIs due to
S. aureus, a TTP of ≤12 h was a predictor of the clinical outcome.

AB  - OBJECTIVES

Time to blood culture positivity (TTP) has been suggested as a
prognostic factor for adverse clinical outcome. This study describes
the relationship between TTP and clinical outcome in all patients with
Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) in a large Canadian health
region.

METHODS

We performed a retrospective study of all first episodes of SAB
occurring in the former Calgary Health Region (population
approximately 1.2 million) from July 1, 2006 to December 31, 2008.

RESULTS

Overall, 684 cases of SAB were evaluated. The median TTP was 16 h and
31/684 (5%) cases had TTP at >48 h. Time to positivity was shorter for
methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus compared with
methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and for endovascular sources
compared with other sources of infection. The overall 30-day
case-fatality rate was 18% (124/684). Patients with delayed TTP (>48
h) suffered the highest case-fatality rate (39%) compared to those
with earlier TTP (17%; P = 0.002). Multivariable logistic regression
modeling showed that age, nosocomial acquisition, MRSA, focus of
infection, liver disease, and TTP < or =12 and >48 h were associated
with 30-day mortality.

CONCLUSION

Although uncommon, delayed TTP may be associated with increased
mortality. Empiric antimicrobial therapy should continue beyond 48 h
in patients at high risk for SAB.

AB  - A short time to positivity (TTP) correlates with poor clinical outcome
in patients with Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia, but the
association between sequential TTPs and the outcome of these patients
is unclear. Sequential TTPs from patients with S. aureus bacteraemia
persisting for >48 h were analysed with respect to clinical parameters
and patient outcome at a tertiary hospital. During the 5-year study
period, 87 patients (9.2%; mean age of 64 years) had persistent S.
aureus bacteraemia, with an average Pittsburgh bacteraemia score of
2.7. Forty-eight patients (55%) had methicillin-resistant S. aureus
infection, and 28 (32%) had nosocomial infection. The most common
underlying disease was end-stage renal disease (43%). The most common
type of infection was catheter-related infection (31%), followed by
infective endocarditis (18%). The in-hospital mortality rate was 40%.
Higher Pittsburgh scores (p 0.005; OR 1.37; 95% CI 1.1-1.7) and a
second TTP/first TTP ratio of <1.5 (p 0.004; OR 0.2; 95% CI 0.07-0.6)
were independent risk factors for mortality. Among patients receiving
adequate empirical therapy, a second positive blood culture growing
within 12 h was more frequent in patients who finally died. Factors
associated with a second TTP/first TTP ratio of <1.5 included older
age (p 0.02; OR 0.96; 95% CI 0.92-0.99) and inadequate empirical
antimicrobial therapy (p 0.01; OR 3.53; 95% CI 1.42-8.78). Among
patients with persistent S. aureus bacteraemia, a second TTP/first TTP
ratio of <1.5 is a predictor of poor outcome. Physicians should search
for interventions guaranteeing that all patients with S. aureus
bacteraemia receive adequate empirical therapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND

Previous studies indicated that the time to positivity (TTP) of blood
culture is a parameter correlating with degree of the bacteremia and
outcome in patients with bloodstream infections caused by Escherichia
coli (E. coli). The objective of this study was to further investigate
the diagnostic and prognostic power of using TTP to predict E. coli
bacteremia.

METHODS

A retrospective cohort study at two university hospitals was
conducted. We retrieved all the medical records of those with E. coli
bloodstream infection according to the records generated by their
microbiology departments. Univariate and multivariate analyses were
applied to identify clinical factors correlating with fast bacterial
growth and significant prognostic factors for hospital mortality.

RESULTS

Medical records of 353 episodes of E. coli bacteremia diagnosed
between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2009 were retrieved in the
investigation. Univariate analysis demonstrated that the TTP ≤ 7 hours
group is associated with higher incidence of active malignancies
(41.7% vs. 27.2%, P = 0.010), neutropenia (30% vs.14.3%, P = 0.007),
primary bacteremia (55.0% vs. 33.4%, P = 0.002), and poorer outcome
(hospital mortality 43.3% vs.11.9%, P = 0.000) than the TTP > 7 hours
group. Multivariate analysis revealed that the significant predictors
of hospital mortality, in rank order from high to low, were TTP (for
TTP ≤ 7 hours, odds ratio (OR): 4.886; 95% confidence interval (CI):
2.572 - 9.283; P = 0.000), neutropenia (OR: 2.800; 95%CI: 1.428 -
5.490; P = 0.003), comedication of steroids or immunosuppressive
agents (OR: 2.670; 95%CI: 0.971 - 7.342; P = 0.057).

CONCLUSIONS

Incidence of malignancies, neutropenia and primary bacteremia
correlates with fast bacterial growth in patients with E. coli
bacteremia. The parameter of TTP has been identified as a variable of
highest correlation to hospital mortality and therefore can be
potentially utilized as a mortality prognostic marker.

AB  - OBJECTIVE

The time to positivity (TTP) of blood cultures in patients with
bloodstream infections (BSIs) has been considered to be a possible
prognostic tool for some bacterial species. However, notable
differences have been found between sampling designs and statistical
methods in published studies to date, which makes it difficult to
compare results or to derive reliable conclusions. Our objective was
to evaluate the clinical and microbiological implications of TTP among
patients with BSI caused by the most common pathogens.

METHODS

A total of 361 episodes of BSI were reported for 332 patients. The
survival of the entire cohort was measured from the time of blood
culture sampling. In order to compare our results with those of
previous studies, TTP was divided in three different groups based on
log rank (short TTP <12h; medium TTP ≥12h to ≤27h, and long TTP >27h).
Cox proportional hazard models were used to calculate crude and
adjusted hazard ratios (HR).

RESULTS

The Cox proportional hazard model revealed that TTP is an independent
predictor of mortality (HR=1.00, p=0.031) in patients with BSIs. A
higher mortality was found in the group of patients with the shortest
TTP (<12h) (HR=2.100, p=0.047), as well as those with longest TTP
(>27h) (HR=3.277, p=0.031).

CONCLUSIONS

It seems that TTP may provide a useful prognostic tool associated with
a higher risk of mortality, not only in patients with shorter TTP, but
also in those with longer TTP.

AB  - We read with interest the recent publication by Kahn et al., who
derived and validated the POSITIVE scoring system to predict the
likelihood of infective endocarditis (IE) in patients with
Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia (SAB) [[1]Kahn F. Resman F. Bergmark

sensitivity and specificity of time to blood culture positivity as a
predictor of IE and found that in patients with no prior antimicrobial
use, time to positivity (TTP) of ≤13 hr had 100% sensitivity in
predicting IE. Staphylococcus aureus remains one of the most common
causes of IE, in part due to its ability to adhere to cardiac valves
and create biofilms. Biofilms are thought to play an important role in
IE pathogenesis in both native and prosthetic valve infection through
different mechanisms that include providing an environment for the
selection of bacterial phenotypes that vary in metabolism and are
difficult to treat due to reduced antimicrobial penetration and
susceptibility to cell wall active agents. Blood cultures remain the
most important diagnostic modality in defining the cause of infective
endocarditis. Blood cultures technology have improved significantly
over the past few decades and automated continuous monitoring systems
that utilize liquid media have become the standard method in most
laboratories [[2]Opota O. Croxatto A. Prod'hom G. Greub G. Blood

PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar]. In adults, each blood culture
bottle typically requires 8–10 mL of blood, which is then incubated in
automated blood culture detection systems that flag positive when a
baseline level of a bacterial concentration is reached, usually
detected by a change in CO2 or pressure in the bottles. In addition to
bacterial concentration, other factors may be operative in TTP. First,
the volume of blood drawn, as the higher the volume of blood cultures,
the higher the yield of detection; however, a clear relationship with
TTP still needs to be determined [[3]Bouza E. Sousa D.

cultured still a significant factor in the diagnosis of bloodstream
infections?.J Clin Microbiol. 2007; 45: 2765-2769Crossref PubMed
Scopus (93) Google Scholar]. Second, a major factor influencing TTP is
the time lag between blood culture collection and initiation of
incubation in an automated system; studies suggest that a delay in
processing may increase TTP and false-positive Gram stains [[4]Schwetz

Scopus (21) Google Scholar]. Additionally, prior antimicrobial therapy
may affect TTP by decreasing the microbial burden and affecting growth
of bacteria in culture media. Lastly, host-related factors, including
host immune response and duration of illness, may also possibly play a
role. All of these confounders may make it difficult to standardize
TTP as a predictor of IE due to variations in institutional practices.
Previous studies have shown that a shorter TTP is an independent
predictor of endovascular source of infection, metastatic infection
and mortality in SAB. TTP ≤12 hr has been associated with higher rates
of in-hospital mortality (25% vs. 4.3%, p 0.006) [[5]Marra A.R. Edmond

diagnosis of IE was 65%, 65% and 74%, respectively, whereas
specificity was 75.7%, 74% and 70%, respectively, with a negative
predictive value of 94%, 94% and 95%, respectively. All patients with
IE had a TTP of ≤18 hr. Additionally, the number of positive blood
culture bottles that were obtained on presentation was higher in
patients with IE than in those without IE. These observations suggest
that TTP can be a valuable laboratory tool in predicting an
endovascular source of infection, mortality and other infectious
complications. However, standardization of laboratory practices that
involve different populations and institutions is likely to be
difficult. At a minimum, individual medical centres should develop
patient management strategies that include standardized quality
indicators and are applied to each patient with SAB in the future.
Ultimately, the development of practice guidelines of SAB that address
TTP and other markers of disease complexity are needed in the global
practice of infectious diseases and are currently being developed. The
authors have no conflicts of interest relevant to this letter.

AB  - OBJECTIVES

Time to positivity (TTP), calculated automatically in modern blood
culture systems, is considered a proxy for microbial load and has been
suggested as a potential prognostic marker in bloodstream infections.
In this large, multicentre, prospectively collected cohort, our
primary analysis aimed to quantify the relationship between the TTP of
monomicrobial blood cultures and mortality.

METHODS

Data from a multicentre randomized controlled trial (RAPIDO) in
bloodstream infection were analysed. Bloodstream infections were
classified into 13 groups/subgroups. The relationship between
mortality and TTP was assessed by logistic regression, adjusted for
site, organism, and clinical variables, and linear regression was
applied to examine the association between clinical variables and TTP.
Robustness was assessed by sensitivity analysis.

RESULTS

In total 4468 participants were included in the RAPIDO. After
exclusions, 3462 were analysed, with the most common organisms being
coagulase-negative staphylococci (1072 patients) and Escherichia coli
(861 patients); 785 patients (22.7%) died within 28 days. We found no
relationship between TTP and mortality for any groups except for
streptococci (odds ratio (OR) with each hour 0.98, 95%CI 0.96-1.00)
and Candida (OR 1.03, 95%CI 1.00-1.05). There was large variability
between organisms and sites in TTP. Fever (geometric mean ratio (GMR)
0.95, 95%CI 0.92-0.99), age (GMR per 10 years 1.01, 95%CI 1.00-1.02),
and neutrophilia were associated with TTP (GMR 1.03, 95%CI 1.02-1.04).

CONCLUSIONS

Time to positivity is not associated with mortality, except in the
case of Candida spp. (longer times associated with worse outcomes) and
possibly streptococci (shorter times associated with worse outcomes).

limiting external validity.

AB  - Introduction: To evaluate the prognostic value of the
time-to-positivity in patients with culture-positive septic shock.
Methods: Retrospective study using a prospective data registry was
performed at the emergency department of a tertiary hospital.
Consecutive adult patients with septic shock (N = 2499) were enrolled
between 2014 and 2018. Bacteremia was defined using blood cultures,
and viral and fungal pathogens were excluded. The primary outcome was
the 28-day mortality. Results: In 803 (46.7%) septic shock patients
with bacteremia, median TTP was 10.1 h. The most prevalent isolated
bacterial pathogens were Escherichia coli (40.8%) and Klebsiella
(23.4%). Although the TTP correlated with a higher sequential organ
failure assessment score (Spearman’s rho = −0.12, p < 0.01), it showed
no significant difference between the 28-day survivors and
non-survivors (10.2 vs. 9.4 days, p = 0.35). In subgroup analysis of
the Escherichia coli and Klebsiella bacteremia cases, a shorter TTP
showed prognostic value for predicting the 28-day mortality. The
optimal TTP cut-off for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella was 10 h and 8
h, respectively. Conclusions: The prognostic value of the TTP in
septic shock patients receiving bundle therapy may be limited and its
clinical interpretation should only be made on a pathogen-specific
basis.

AB  - OBJECTIVES

The time to positivity (TTP), measured as the time span between the
start of incubation and the alert signal from the blood culture
device, has been described as useful tool of prognosis in patients
suffering from blood stream infection with Staphylococcus aureus,
Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumonia. The present study
investigates the relationship between TTP and in-hospital mortality in
patients with monomicrobial Pseudomonas aeruginosa blood stream
infection (PA-BSI).

METHODS

From 2006 until 2012 a retrospective cohort study was undertaken in 3
hospitals in the region surrounding Tübingen, Germany. Seventy-four
patients with monomicrobial PA-BSI were studied. TTP and clinical
parameters were determined and analyzed by receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) analysis and Cox regression.

RESULTS

The in-hospital mortality of our clinical cohort was 33.78%. In
multivariate Cox regression, a TTP ≤ 18 h proved to be independently
associated with mortality (HR 3.83, P = 0.012) along with SAPS II
score (HR 1.04, P = 0.006), cardiac disease (HR 0.33, P = 0.008) and
appropriate definitive antimicrobial treatment (HR 0.21, P = 0.013).

CONCLUSIONS

TTP is an easy-to-measure laboratory tool for prognosis in patients
with monomicrobial PA-BSI, providing useful information in addition to
clinical parameters.

AB  - The role of sequential blood culture time to positivity (TTP) as a
surrogate marker for bacterial load and as a prognostic indicator in
S. aureus bacteremia (SAB) is not well established in the literature.

We performed a single healthcare system, multi-site, retrospective
review of adult patients with positive blood culture for S. aureus
between January 2019 and December 2019. Sequential TTP was defined as
the TTP of the first subsequent blood cultures obtained from patients
with SAB for at least 24 hours. We adapted the previously described
TTP ratio of < 1.5 as the cut-off for study groups. Infective
endocarditis (IE) was defined according to modified Duke’s criteria.
High-grade bacteremia was defined as the growth of the organism in two
or more sets of blood cultures or growth in >50% of all bottles
collected. Descriptive, comparative statistics and survival analysis
were performed using Python 3 and IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows,
Version 27.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.

A total of 602 patients with SAB were identified, and 186 patients who
met the study criteria were included. Sixty-nine patients (37%) were
female, and the mean age was 63.6 years. Patients with initial TTP <
12 hours had higher 30-day and 90-day mortality than those with
initial TTP ≥ 12 hours. Patients with TTP ratio of > 1.5 had higher
rates of cardiac prosthetic device (30 [26.1%] vs. 9 [12.7%], p = .03)
and high-grade bacteremia (106 [92.2%] vs. 56 [78.9%], p = .01). In
univariate analysis, history of myocardial infarction, cardiac
prosthetic device, and findings of high-grade bacteremia and native
valve vegetation in echocardiogram were significant predictors for a
TTP ratio of < 1.5. In multivariate analysis, native valve vegetation
(OR 2.4; 95% CI 1.2-4.84), and high-grade bacteremia (OR, 0.3; 95% CI,
0.13- 0.77) were independent predictors (Table 1 and 2). No
differences in 30- day or 90-day survival based on the TTP ratio were
seen (Figure 1). Figure 1.Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves and log rank test
results based on time to positivity (TTP) of initial blood cultures
and TTP ratio of sequential to initial blood culture

The X-axis represents the days elapsed from the initial blood culture
collection. Number of patients at risk and events are given below the
x-axis for each group. 30-day and 90-day survival rates were
significantly lower in patients with initial TTP of < 12 hours
compared with those with ≥ 12 hours. There were no statistically
significant differences in survival based on TTP ratio.

In patients with SAB, a second TTP to first TPP ratio of > 1.5 was
associated with higher rates of presence of the cardiac prosthetic
device and high-grade bacteremia. Initial TTP < 12 hours was
associated with lower survival; however sequential TTP ratio didn’t
predict mortality.

AB  - Background Blood cultures are considered the gold standard to
distinguish bacteremia from non-bacteremic systemic inflammation. In
current clinical practice, bacteraemia is considered unlikely if blood
cultures have been negative for 48–72 hours. Modern BC systems have
reduced this time-to-positivity (TTP), questioning whether the time
frame of 48–72 hrs is still valid. This study investigates the
distribution of TTP, the probability of blood culture positivity after
24 hours, and identifies clinical predictors of prolonged TTP. Methods
Adult patients with monomicrobial bacteremia in an academic hospital
were included retrospectively over a three-year period. Clinical data
were retrieved from the medical records. Predictors of TTP >24 hours
were determined by uni- and multivariate analyses. The residual
probability of bacteremia was estimated for the scenario of negative
BCs at 24 hours after bedside collection. Results The cohort consisted
of 801 patients, accounting for 897 episodes of bacteremia. Mean age
was 65 years (IQR 54–73), 534 (59.5%) patients were male. Median TTP
was 15.7 (IQR 13.5–19.3) hours. TTP was ≤24 hours in 85.3% of
episodes. Antibiotic pre-treatment (adjusted OR 1.77; 95%CI 1.14–2.74,
p<0.01) was independently associated with prolonged TTP. The
probability of bacteremia, if BC had remained negative for 24 hours,
was 1.8% (95% CI 1.46–2.14). Conclusion With adequate hospital
logistics, the probability of positive blood cultures after 24 hours
of negative cultures was low. Combined with clinical reassessment,
knowledge of this low probability may contribute to prioritization of
the differential diagnosis and decisions on antimicrobial therapy. As
a potential antibiotic stewardship tool, this strategy warrants
further prospective investigation.

AB  - Time-to-positivity (TTP) is defined as the length of time from the
beginning of culture incubation to the detection of bacterial growth
by an automated system. The objective of this study was to assess the
clinical and microbiological implications of TTP among patients with
Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) bacteremia. This was a prospective,
single-center, observational study. Patients aged 18 years or older
with one or more blood cultures growing GNB were included and followed
until hospital discharge or death. Patients were excluded if they were
without symptoms of infection, if they had polymicrobial culture, or
if the culture was positive with an obligate anaerobe. A multivariate
logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the predictors
of in-hospital mortality, including TTP (primary endpoint),
demographics, disease severity, comorbidities, pathogen type, source
of infection, time to symptom resolution, hospital/intensive care unit
(ICU) length of stay, adequacy of empiric antibiotics, and presence of
an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing bacteria. One
hundred consecutive patients with GNB bacteremia were enrolled. TTP
was an independent predictor of mortality; for every hour that TTP was
shorter, the risk of mortality increased by 10% [odds ratio (OR) 1.10,
95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00-1.21, p = 0.049]. Other predictors
of mortality included severity of illness, ESBL-producing GNB, and ICU
admission within 24 h before culture. Mortality was highest among
patients with inadequate empiric therapy (56% vs. 14%, p < 0.001) and
TTP <11 h (23.1% vs. 8.3%, p = 0.18). Lactose-fermenting GNB had a
shorter mean TTP than non-lactose fermenters (11.4 vs. 17.9 h, p =
0.001). Among patients with bacteremia due to GNB, TTP values are
inversely associated with mortality risk.

AB  - Objectives We aimed to investigate the association between the time to
positivity of blood culture (TTP) with clinical outcome and severity
of pneumococcal bacteremic pneumonia. Methods Prospective
observational study carried out in 278 hospitalized adult CAP patients
with positive blood culture for Streptococcus pneumonia (2003–2015).
Results A total of 278 cases of bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia were
analyzed, median age 62 (46; 79) years. Fifty-one percent of the cases
had PSI IV-V. Twenty-one (8%) died within 30-days after admission. The
analysis of the TTP showed that the first quartile of the TTP (9.2h)
was the best cut-off for differentiating 2 groups of patients at risk,
early (TTP <9.2 h) and late (TTP ≥9.2 h) detection groups (AUC 0.66
[95% CI 0.53 to 0.79]). Early TTP was associated with a statistically
significant risk of invasive mechanical ventilation (18% vs. 6%, p =
0.007), longer length of hospital stay (12 days vs. 8 days, p<0.001),
higher in-hospital mortality (15% vs. 4%, p = 0.010), and 30-day
mortality (15% vs. 5%, p = 0.018). After adjustment for potential
confounders, regression analyses revealed early TTP as independently
associated with high risk of invasive mechanical ventilation (OR 4.60,
95% CI 1.63 to 13.03), longer length of hospital stay (β 5.20, 95% CI
1.81 to 8.52), higher in-hospital mortality (OR 5.35, 95% CI 1.55 to
18.53), and a trend to higher 30-day mortality (OR 2.47, 95% CI 0.85
to 7.21) to be a contributing factor. Conclusion Our results
demonstrate that TTP is an easy to obtain surrogate marker of the
severity of pneumococcal pneumonia and a good predictor of its
outcome.

AB  - The time from the start of incubation to a positive reading of blood
cultures (time-to-positivity; TTP) is related to the concentration of
bacteria in blood. Information concerning the correlation of TTP with
clinical parameters, and its usefulness as a prognostic factor in
patients with Escherichia coli bacteraemia, is limited. To investigate
the relationship of TTP to clinical parameters, 459 cases of
monomicrobial E. coli bloodstream infections from a single institution
between 1997 and 2005 were reviewed. All cases involved patients who
were not undergoing antibiotic treatment at the time of blood
sampling. The in-hospital mortality rate was 6.3%. Median TTP was
significantly shorter for patients who died than for those who
survived (9.7 h, inter-quartile range 7.85-11.05 h vs. 11.2 h,
inter-quartile range 10.1-11.4 h; p <0.001). Patients with TTP in the
lowest quartile were more likely to be female, to have a non-urinary
tract or an unknown origin of bacteraemia, to have severe sepsis or
shock, and to subsequently die. In a multivariable Cox regression
model, the hazard ratio for death from any cause for patients with a
short TTP was 3.13 (95% CI 1.28-7.64; p 0.01). TTP in patients with E.
coli bacteraemia provides prognostic information beyond that provided
by the presence of haematological illness, a Charlson score > or =3, a
non-urinary tract origin of bacteraemia, and the presence of severe
sepsis or shock.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between
the time to positivity (TTP) of blood cultures and outcome in patients
with bloodstream infections (BSIs). Between January 1st, 2011 and
December 31st, 2013, the blood cultures of inpatients with BSI or
catheter-related BSI were collected at Peking University Third
Hospital. The TTP of different isolates was analyzed, and the
relationship between the TTP of isolates and outcome of patients with
Enterobacter BSI was retrospectively analyzed. We analyzed the TTP of
886 isolates. Escherichia coli has the shortest (11.97 ± 10.06 h) and
Candida has the longest first TTP (61.62 ± 42.77 h). 68.01 % of
isolates reached positivity within 24 h and 88.33 % within 48 h. Over
90 % of E. coli isolates reached positivity within 24 h. Over 50 % of
Candida isolates reached positivity within 48 h. The TTP differed
significantly between cultures that were single or double positive for
coagulase-negative staphylococci isolates, Enterobacteriaceae, and
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and between aerobic and anaerobic cultures of
E. coli (p < 0.05). However, the TTP did not differ significantly
between coagulase-negative staphylococci (double positivity) and
Staphylococcus aureus. The best TTP threshold for prediction of
mortality from Enterobacter species BSI was 16.3 h [area under the
curve (AUC) 0.730, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.557, 0.864,
sensitivity 100 %, specificity 44.4 %]. The TTP of clinical isolates
may represent a valuable marker of the clinical significance of BSIs.
Laboratories and clinics should consider using the TTP to predict the
prognosis of patients with BSI by bacteria, including Enterobacter and
other species.

for catheter-related bloodstream infection and distinguishment on
bacteria group and infection source has been investigated. However,
the relationship between TTP and patient outcome requires
verification, and we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis.
Methods We searched PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Web of
Science for publications associated with the topic. We included
studies that researched the TTP on predicting patient mortality and
septic shock. Quality assessment is performed with Critical Appraisal
Skills Programme (CASP). The analysis is performed using Review
Manager Version 5.0.24. on articles available for data extraction on
the exact population of each outcome group. The existence of
publication bias was assessed by funnel plots. Statistical
heterogeneity was evaluated using the Cochran Q and $${I}^{2}$$

eligible studies were included in our study. Twenty-four in the
mortality group and six in the septic shock group. Mortality is
significantly associated with the short time to positivity group with
an odds ratio of 2.98 (95% CI: 2.25–3.96, p-value &lt; 0.001). The
odds ratio for developing septic shock in the short TTP group is 4.06
(95% CI: 2.41–6.84, p-value &lt; 0.001). Subgroup analysis revealed
short TTP as a significant predictor of mortality and septic shock in
Gram's positive and Gram's negative related bloodstream infections.
TTP is not associated with mortality among patients with candidaemia.
Conclusions Short time to positivity is a reliable marker for patient
outcome in certain bacterial species. Studies concerning confounding
factors such as the delay in bottle loading and other confounding
factors are needed to enhance external validity.

AB  - The time to positivity (TTP) of blood cultures has been associated
with increased mortality in bacteremia caused by several
microorganisms. The aim of this study is to evaluate the relationship
between TTP and prognosis, clinical presentation and extended spectrum
B-lactamase (ESBL)-production in patients with Escherichia coli
bacteremia. This is a retrospective observational study involving 226
adult patients with E. coli bacteremia. Data collected included
underlying diseases, clinical presentation, prognosis factors, TTP,
ESBL-production and outcome. Thirty-one (14%) patients had severe
sepsis and 29 (13%) septic shock at presentation. Thirty-three (14%)
strains were ESBL-producers. Thirty-nine (17%) patients died during
admission and 17 (7.5%) within 48 hours. The median TTP was 8.3 hours
(range, 0.42–76.5). It was significantly shorter in patients with
septic shock (6.23 h, range 1.12–47.29 h vs. 8.51 h, range 0.42–76.50
h; p = 0.018). Rapid growth of E. coli, Pitt index >1.5, non-urinary
source and Charlson score >2 were selected as independent risk factors
of in-hospital mortality by the multivariate analysis. ESBL-production
was not associated with modifications in TTP. Lower TTP is an
independent risk factor for septic shock and poor outcome in episodes
of E. coli bacteremia. The TTP in E. coli bacteremia is not
significantly modified by ESBL-production.

AB  - OBJECTIVES

To investigate the impact of the time-to-positivity of blood cultures
(TTP) on 30-day mortality in patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa
bacteremia.

METHODS

All nonduplicated episodes of P. aeruginosa monomicrobial bacteremia
in adult patients from January 2013 to February 2020 were analysed.
Epidemiological and clinical data were collected. TTP of blood
cultures for P. aeruginosa isolates was automatically recorded.
Multivariate analysis identified factors predicting 30-day overall
mortality.

RESULTS

A total of 328 patients were identified. The median TTP for P.
aeruginosa isolates was 15 h (interquartile range [IQR] 12-18 h). All
multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant (MDR/XDR) episodes
were positive within the first 36 h. The 30-day mortality rate was
32.3%. The best cut-off value of the TTP for predicting mortality was
16 h (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.62, 95%
confidence interval [CI] 0.56-0.67, P = 0.001). The 30-day mortality
rate was significantly higher in the TTP ≤16 h group (41.0% vs. 19.5%,
P < 0.001). In a multivariate analysis, severe neutropenia (adjusted
odds ratio [aOR] 2.67, 95% CI 1.4-5.09, P = 0.002), septic shock (aOR
3.21, 95% CI 1.57-5.89, P < 0.001), respiratory source (aOR 4.37, 95%
CI 2.24-8.52, P < 0.001), nosocomial acquisition (aOR 1.99, 95% CI
1.06-3.71, P = 0.030), TTP ≤16 h (aOR 2.27, 95% CI 2.12-4.25,
P = 0.010), and MDR/XDR phenotype (aOR 2.54, 95% CI 1.38-4.67,
P = 0.002) were independently associated with 30-day mortality.

CONCLUSIONS

A short TTP (≤16 h) was independently associated with increased 30-day
mortality. After local validation, this routinely available
microbiological parameter might be useful for guiding empirical
antipseudomonal therapies and supporting the close monitoring of
patients with P. aeruginosa bacteremia.

AB  - OBJECTIVES

The time to positivity (TTP) of blood cultures is associated with the
microbial load in the blood and prognosis in patients with bloodstream
infections caused by various bacterial species. However, relevant
information about the TTP for Candida species in candidaemia is
limited. We investigated the clinical impact of the TTP on mortality
in patients with candidaemia.

METHODS

All consecutive patients ≥ 18 years of age with candidaemia between
January 2006 and July 2012 were included. The demographics, clinical
and microbiological characteristics, antifungal treatment and outcomes
of the patients were collected retrospectively.

RESULTS

A total of 152 patients were identified. The overall mortality rate at
6 weeks was 53%. The median TTP for Candida isolates was 27 h (IQR
19-37 h). A TTP of ≤ 24 h was significantly related to a higher
mortality rate (P = 0.021). In a multivariate Cox regression analysis,
the Charlson comorbidity index value [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.15,
95% CI 1.02-1.29, P = 0.018], sequential organ failure assessment
score (adjusted HR 1.23, 95% CI 1.13-1.34, P < 0.001), TTP ≤ 24 h
(adjusted HR 2.74, 95% CI 1.51-4.97, P = 0.001), timing of appropriate
antifungal therapy >72 h (adjusted HR 2.38, 95% CI 1.26-4.51, P =
0.008) and persistent candidaemia (adjusted HR 2.50, 95% CI 1.33-4.72,
P = 0.005) were independently associated with the 6 week mortality
rate.

CONCLUSIONS

A short TTP (≤ 24 h) for Candida species was independently associated
with increased mortality in patients with candidaemia. Additional
studies on the relevance of the TTP to clinical outcome in patients
with candidaemia are needed.

AB  - Few studies have assessed the time to blood culture positivity as a
predictor of clinical outcome in fungal bloodstream infections (BSIs).
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the time to positivity (TTP)
of blood cultures in patients with Candida albicans BSIs and to assess
its impact on clinical outcome.A historical cohort study with 89
adults patients with C. albicans BSIs. TTP was defined as the time
between the start of incubation and the time that the automated alert
signal indicating growth in the culture bottle sounded.Patients with
BSIs and TTPs of culture of ≤ 36 h (n=39) and >36 h (n=50) were
compared. Septic shock occurred in 46.2% of patients with TTPs of ≤ 36
h and in 40.0% of patients with TTP of >36 h (p=0.56). A central
venous catheter source was more common with a BSI TTP of ≤ 36 h
(p=0.04). Univariate analysis revealed that APACHE II score ≥ 20 at
BSI onset, the development of at least one organ system failure
(respiratory, cardiovascular, renal, hematologic, or hepatic), SOFA at
BSI onset, SAPS II at BSI onset, and time to positivity were
associated with death. By using logistic regression analysis, the only
independent predictor of death was time to positivity (1.04; 95% CI,
1.0-1.1, p=0.035), with the chance of the patient with C. albicans BSI
dying increasing 4.0% every hour prior to culture positivity.A longer
time to positivity was associated with a higher mortality for Candida
albicans BSIs; therefore, initiating empiric treatment with
antifungals may improve outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND

Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia often persists and causes metastatic
infections. It is unknown whether the time between blood culture
incubation and growth detection (i.e., the time to positivity) in a
continuously monitored system--a probable surrogate marker of
bacteremia severity--correlates with outcome.

METHODS

We performed a prospective, observational study involving adult
inpatients who had S. aureus bacteremia between 1 January 2002 and 30
June 2003 at a 600-bed teaching hospital. Measurements included time
to positivity in initial blood culture series, duration of bacteremia,
rate of metastatic infection, and outcome.

RESULTS

A total of 376 S. aureus bacteremias (> or = 1 positive blood culture
result) were reported for 357 patients aged 18-103 years (median age,
59 years); 64 bacteremias were excluded because blood was drawn after
antibiotic therapy was started (n = 59) or through an intravascular
catheter (n = 5). The source of infection was identified in 244 series
(78.2%). Metastatic infection was detected in 25 bacteremias (8.0%).
The mortality rate was 25.6%. The duration of bacteremia (determined
in 251 series) was 1-59 days (median duration, 1 day; 70th percentile,
3 days). The time to positivity ranged from 4.2 to 98.2 h (median time
to positivity, 15.5 h) and was significantly shorter for patients with
an endovascular source of infection (14.9+/-5.4 vs. 19.5+/-10.6 h; P <
.0005), extended duration (i.e., > or = 3 days) of bacteremia
(14.1+/-4.2 vs. 18.6+/-9.2 h; P < .0005), and metastatic infection
(12.9+/-5.9 vs 18.0+/-9.3 h; P = .007). Analysis of a range of cutoff
values demonstrated that a time to positivity of < or = 14 h yielded
the best sensitivity and specificity for predicting the source and
outcome of infection. Logistic regression analyses revealed that a
time to positivity of < or = 14 h was an independent predictor of an
endovascular source of infection (P < .0005), extended bacteremia (P <
.0005), metastatic infection (P < .0005), and attributable mortality
(P = .017).

CONCLUSIONS

Time to positivity in S. aureus bacteremia may provide useful
diagnostic and prognostic information. Growth of S. aureus within 14 h
after the initiation of incubation may identify patients with a high
likelihood of endovascular infection sources, delayed clearance, and
complications.

AB  - OBJECTIVES

Time to blood culture positivity (TTP), a routinely available
parameter in automated blood culture systems, may be a proxy for
infectious burden in patients with bloodstream infections. We aimed to
study the association between TTP and infective endocarditis (IE), or
death, in patients with Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia.

METHODS

VIRSTA is a multicentre prospective cohort study that included all
adult patients with S. aureus bacteraemia in eight university
hospitals in France (2009-2011). We analysed data from four centres
which collected data on TTP. Regression models were used to study the
association between TTP and definite IE (Duke-Li criteria), and 30
day-mortality.

RESULTS

We included 587 patients with S. aureus bacteraemia: mean age was
65.3 ± 16.3 years, 420 out of 587 patients (71.6%) were male, 121 out
of 587 (20.6%) died, and 42 out of 587 (7.2%) had definite IE. Median
TTP of first positive blood culture was 13.7 h (interquartile range
9.9-18). On multivariate analysis, 30-day mortality was associated
with TTP ≤13.7 h (74/295 (25.1%) vs. 47/292 (16.1%), p 0.02), as well
as old age, McCabe score, methicillin resistance, stroke, pneumonia,
and C-reactive protein. TTP was also independently associated with IE,
but with a U-shape curve: IE was more common in the first (TTP <10 h,
17/148, 11.5%), and the last (TTP ≥18 h, 8/146, 5.5%) quartiles of
TTP, p 0.002.

CONCLUSIONS

TTP provides reliable information in patients with S. aureus
bacteraemia, on the risk of IE, and prognosis, with short TTP being an
independent predictor of death. These data, readily available at no
cost, may be used to identify patients who require specific attention.

AB  - Among 500 patients with bacteremia and fungemia, total mortality was
42%; about half of all deaths were attributable directly to infection.
Mortality increased with age, but deaths unrelated to infection itself
were responsible in part for this increase. Mortality was 2.6% among
obstetric-gynecologic patients, 42% among medical patients, 49% among
surgical patients, and 60% among transplant patients. The risk of
death was especially high with enterococcal, facultative
gram-negative, fungal, polymicrobial, or hospital-acquired sepsis; in
the presence of shock, leukopenia, absolute granulocytopenia, or
defined predisposing conditions (neoplasia, cirrhosis, and
combinations of factors such as surgery and renal failure); and with a
primary infected focus in the respiratory tract, the skin, a surgical
wound, an abscess, or an unknown site. Body temperature was inversely
related to mortality. Survival was increased by the use of appropriate
antibiotics and, where applicable, additional therapeutic maneuvers
(e.g., drainage). Multivariate analysis defined seven variables that
independently influenced outcome: microorganism, blood pressure, body
temperature, primary focus of infection, place of acquisition of
infection, age, and predisposing factors. Although some adverse
prognostic factors are not amenable to intervention, prevention of
nosocomial bacteremia and fungemia and early reversal of hypotension
may reduce the death rate from sepsis.

AB  - The global burden of morbidity and mortality from sepsis is
significant (1). Despite overall improvements in clinical outcomes,
patients with sepsis and septic shock have short-term mortality rates
approaching 20% (2). Although initial data for new treatments, such as
activated protein C (3, 4), intensive insulin therapy (5),
levosimendan (6), and -blockers (7), were promising, no novel
host-directed therapies have consistently demonstrated a reduction in
sepsis-associated mortality. The cornerstone of sepsis management
continues to be early antimicrobial administration, source control,
and supportive care (811). The Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines
recommend that blood cultures be drawn before starting antimicrobial
therapy, with 45-minute delays considered acceptable to achieve this
goal (12). However, prompt initiation of effective antimicrobial
therapy is a critical determinant of survival (13). Death has been
associated with delayed antimicrobial therapy after the onset of
septic shock (1417). Therefore, it is possible that administering
antimicrobial agents before obtaining blood cultures could potentially
decrease time to treatment and improve outcomes. Although specific
microbiological diagnoses and antimicrobial susceptibility testing are
important for determining the type and duration of treatment, the
diagnostic sensitivity of blood cultures drawn shortly after
antimicrobial administration in this population is not known. The
purpose of this study was to determine whether the sensitivity of
blood cultures decreased after administration of antimicrobial agents
in patients with severe manifestations of sepsis. Methods Study Design
We conducted the FABLED (eFfect of Antimicrobial administration on
BLood culture positivity in patients with severe manifestations of
sepsis in the Emergency Department) study, a patient-level,
single-group, diagnostic study. The protocol was designed by the study
management committee and reflects the standard of care in the
participating institutions (Supplement). Seven urban emergency
departments across Canada and the United States participated in the
study. The research ethics boards at each recruiting center approved
the protocol. The investigators remained unaware of the results
throughout the enrollment period. The authors vouch for the data and
analysis and for the fidelity of this report to the study protocol.
Supplement. Supplementary Material. Participants We recruited adult
patients (aged 18 years) who presented to the emergency department
with severe manifestations of sepsis, who had 2 sets of blood cultures
drawn before starting antibiotic therapy, and who were able to have
additional sets drawn within 2 hours of empirical antimicrobial
administration. The Supplement provides detailed inclusion and
exclusion criteria. In brief, evidence of a systemic inflammatory
response syndrome (18) as well as a presumed or confirmed source of
infection in patients was required. Evidence of severity, including
systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg at prehospital assessment
or in the emergency department or a serum lactate level of 4 mmol/L or
greater (1921), was also required. These markers of severity were
chosen because they are more likely to be present in patients with
bloodstream infections and are associated with an increased risk for
death independent of organ failure or shock (19, 20, 2224). Moreover,
these variables are associated with a sicker patient population that
is more likely to benefit from early empirical antimicrobial therapy.
Patients were excluded if they had a clinically significant bleeding
disorder, a platelet count less than 20000 109 cells/L, or an
international normalized ratio greater than 6.0 because of the
potential risk for harm from the additional venipuncture. Diagnostic
Procedure Two sets of blood cultures were obtained from study
participants before antimicrobial administration. Each set consisted
of 1 aerobic and 1 anaerobic culture vial from a single venipuncture
site; each set required a separate venipuncture. At 2 participating
hospitals, the second set of blood cultures consisted of a single
aerobic vial per institutional policy. After administration of the
first antimicrobial agent, additional blood cultures were obtained. At
5 institutions, 2 additional sets of blood cultures were drawn with
equal blood volumes before and after treatment initiation. At 2
institutions, 1 additional set of blood cultures was drawn after
antimicrobial therapy was started because of institutional review
board requirements to obtain the smallest acceptable blood culture
volume per guideline recommendations (25) (Supplement). After
treatment initiation, additional sets of blood cultures could be
obtained from the same venipuncture to reduce the risk for harm from
additional venipunctures. The protocol stipulated that repeated blood
cultures were to be obtained between 30 and 120 minutes after
treatment initiation. However, the protocol was amended to include
participants with repeated blood cultures up to 240 minutes after
antimicrobial therapy because of the difficulties in obtaining
repeated blood cultures within 120 minutes of treatment initiation.
Antimicrobial agents were administered as standard infusions per
routine practice. Blood cultures were obtained and processed at each
study site according to local standard operating procedures. All other
aspects of clinical care were at the discretion of the treating
emergency physician and were based on local institutional guidelines.
There were no changes in sepsis protocols throughout the study period.
Written informed consent was obtained from all patients or their
surrogate decision maker before enrollment in the study. Given the low
probability of harm to participants and the time-dependent nature of
the diagnostic procedure, the institutional review boards for all
participating institutions approved delayed consent in cases where
patients lacked mental capacity and a surrogate decision maker could
not be reached. In such cases, retrospective written consent was
obtained from patients once they regained capacity or when a surrogate
decision maker could be reached. Baseline demographic and clinical
data were recorded for all patients. Outcomes The primary outcome was
to determine the sensitivity of blood cultures obtained within 120
minutes after antimicrobial therapy was initiated in patients with
severe manifestations of sepsis. We defined preantimicrobial blood
cultures as the reference standard for bacteremia. A noncontaminant
organism (25) growing in any of the preantimicrobial blood cultures,
but absent from all postantimicrobial blood cultures, was defined as a
discordant result. Postantimicrobial blood cultures that grew the same
organisms as those obtained before antimicrobial therapy, regardless
of the number of positive blood culture vials per set, was defined as
a concordant result. In the setting of a polymicrobial bloodstream
infection, all noncontaminant organisms recovered in the
preantimicrobial blood cultures must have been present in the
postantimicrobial blood cultures to have been considered concordant.
Contaminant organisms were defined as low-virulence skin flora
recovered from a single set of blood cultures when other sets were
negative (25) (Supplement). All cases of potential contaminants were
reviewed by 2 specialists (M.P.C. and C.P.Y.) in infectious diseases
and medical microbiology. Appropriate antimicrobial therapy was
defined according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute
interpretive criteria as administration of an antimicrobial agent to
which the pathogen was susceptible (26). The main secondary outcome
was to evaluate the sensitivity of postantimicrobial blood cultures
interpreted in the context of microbiological culture results
available from other anatomical sites. Sample Size On the basis of
previously published data (10, 13) and local sepsis epidemiology, we
estimated conservatively that 35% of patients with severe
manifestations of sepsis would be bacteremic. On the basis of a
matched design, preantimicrobial blood culture positivity proportion
of 35%, desired power of 90%, 2-tailed error rate of 5%, and minimum
clinically significant difference of 10% in sensitivity, 328 patients
were required based on the repeated-measures design of the study. A
10% difference was chosen as the maximum difference in sensitivity
between pre- and postantimicrobial blood cultures that would be deemed
clinically acceptable through consultation with the infectious
disease, emergency medicine, and critical care medicine specialists
involved in development of the study protocol. Statistical Analysis
Data from all hospital centers were consolidated, and the final data
set was inspected for errors, outliers, and missing values. All study
participants had complete data for the exposures and outcomes of
interest. No patients were omitted because of missing data. The
statistical unit of analysis was the blood culture pairing for each
patient. The population for primary analysis was defined as any
participant recruited to the study in whom both pre- and
postantimicrobial (within 240 minutes after initiation of
antimicrobial therapy) blood cultures were obtained. An a priori
decision was made to analyze the results in the per protocol (PP)
population, consisting of participants who had postantimicrobial blood
cultures drawn between 30 and 120 minutes after initiation of
antimicrobial treatment. Baseline patient characteristics are
presented as proportions for categorical variables, means and SDs for
age, and medians and interquartile ranges for nonnormally distributed
data. The sample population was described per preantimicrobial blood
culture results. Nonnormally distributed variables were compared using
the Wilcoxon or the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for unpaired and paired
data, respectively. Binary and categorical data were analyzed using
the Fisher exact test or chi-sq

AB  - Background. Previous reports on molecular rapid diagnostic testing
(mRDT) do not consistently demonstrate improved clinical outcomes in
bloodstream infections (BSIs). This meta-analysis seeks to evaluate
the impact of mRDT in improving clinical outcomes in BSIs. Methods. We
searched PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, and EMBASE through May 2016
for BSI studies comparing clinical outcomes between mRDT and
conventional microbiology methods. Results. Thirty-one studies were
included with 5920 patients. The mortality risk was significantly
lower with mRDT than with conventional microbiology methods (odds
ratio [OR], 0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI], .54–.80), yielding a
number needed to treat of 20. The mortality risk was slightly lower
with mRDT in studies with antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs)
(OR, 0.64; 95% CI, .51–.79), and non-ASP studies failed to demonstrate
a significant decrease in mortality risk (0.72; .46–1.12). Significant
decreases in mortality risk were observed with both gram-positive (OR,
0.73; 95% CI, .55–.97) and gram-negative organisms (0.51; .33–.78) but
not yeast (0.90; .49–1.67). Time to effective therapy decreased by a
weighted mean difference of −5.03 hours (95% CI, −8.60 to −1.45
hours), and length of stay decreased by −2.48 days (−3.90 to −1.06
days). Conclusions. For BSIs, mRDT was associated with significant
decreases in mortality risk in the presence of a ASP, but not in its
absence. mRDT also decreased the time to effective therapy and the
length of stay. mRDT should be considered as part of the standard of
care in patients with BSIs.

AB  - ABSTRACT The marked increase in the incidence of infections due to
antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacilli in recent years is of great
concern, as patients infected by those isolates might initially
receive antibiotics that are inactive against the responsible
pathogens. To evaluate the effect of inappropriate initial
antimicrobial therapy on survival, a total of 286 patients with
antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacteremia, 61 patients with
Escherichia coli bacteremia, 65 with Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia,
74 with Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteremia, and 86 with Enterobacter
bacteremia, were analyzed retrospectively. If a patient received at
least one antimicrobial agent to which the causative microorganisms
were susceptible within 24 h of blood culture collection, the initial
antimicrobial therapy was considered to have been appropriate.
High-risk sources of bacteremia were defined as the lung, peritoneum,
or an unknown source. The main outcome measure was 30-day mortality.
Of the 286 patients, 135 (47.2%) received appropriate initial
empirical antimicrobial therapy, and the remaining 151 (52.8%)
patients received inappropriate therapy. The adequately treated group
had a 27.4% mortality rate, whereas the inadequately treated group had
a 38.4% mortality rate (P = 0.049). Multivariate analysis showed that
the significant independent risk factors of mortality were
presentation with septic shock, a high-risk source of bacteremia, P.
aeruginosa infection, and an increasing APACHE II score. In the
subgroup of patients (n = 132) with a high-risk source of bacteremia,
inappropriate initial antimicrobial therapy was independently
associated with increased mortality (odds ratio, 3.64; 95% confidence
interval, 1.13 to 11.72; P = 0.030). Our data suggest that
inappropriate initial antimicrobial therapy is associated with adverse
outcome in antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacteremia, particularly
in patients with a high-risk source of bacteremia.

AB  - Time to positivity (TTP) and differential TTP (DTP) emerge as
diagnostic and prognostic tools for bloodstream infections (BSI)
though specific cut-off values need to be determined for each
pathogen. Pseudomonas aeruginosa BSI (PAE-BSI) is of critical concern,
particularly in immunocompromised patients, due to high mortality
rates. Catheter-related infections are a common cause, necessitating
rapid and accurate diagnostic tools for effective management
(source-control). Unicentric retrospective observational study
analyzing the diagnostic utility and best cut-off values of time to
positivity (TTP) and differential time to positivity (DTP) to identify
catheter-related PAE-BSI and the association of TTP with 30-day
mortality. 1177 PAE-BSI cases TTP were included in the study. TTP was
available in all episodes whereas DTP was available in 355 episodes.
Breakthrough bacteremia disregarding the TTP, more than one positive
blood culture or > 7 days with a catheter in place and both a
TTP < 13h and a DTP > 2h were independently associated to
catheter-related PAE-BSI. Secondly, lower TTP were significantly
associated with higher 30-day mortality rates in both catheter-related
and non-catheter-related PAE-BSI. For catheter-related infections,
TTP < 14h exacerbated mortality among patients among patients in whom
the catheter was not removed within 48h (OR 2.9[1.04–8]); whereas for
other sources TTP < 16h increased mortality (OR 1.6[1.1–2.4])
particularly when the empiric antibiotic therapy was not active (OR
3.8[1.5–10]). These findings advocate for the routine use of TTP over
DTP as a diagnostic tool to guide timely interventions such as
catheter removal, thereby potentially improving patient outcomes in
PAE-BSI. Moreover, lower TTP have also prognostic implications in both
catheter-related and non-catheter-related infections.

AB  - Time to positivity (TTP) of blood cultures in patients with
bacteraemia is considered to be a predictor of outcome for some
bacterial species. Two hundred and thirty-one patients with Klebsiella
pneumoniae monomicrobial bacteraemia at a hospital from 1 January to
31 December 2007 were prospectively enrolled. TTP <7 h (46 patients,
19.9%) was associated with a higher Pittsburg bacteraemia score (6.2
+/- 5.5 vs. 3.7 +/- 4.3, p 0.002), fewer non-fatal diseases by the
McCabe classification (39.1% vs. 64.9%, p 0.002), a higher percentage
of patients with liver cirrhosis, active malignancy, and chemotherapy
within 3 months (28.3% vs. 11.9%, p 0.007; 28.3% vs. 14.6%, p 0.031;
23.9% vs. 5.4%, p <0.001), more primary bacteraemia (45.7% vs. 22.2%,
p 0.002), and a higher 30-day mortality rate (47.8% vs. 21.1%, p
<0.001). Risk factors for 30-day mortality in the univariate analysis
included higher Pittsburg bacteraemia score (5.8 +/- 5.3 vs. 3.7 +/-
4.3, p 0.002), primary bacteraemia (41.0% vs. 21.8%, p 0.004), TTP <7
h (36.1% vs. 14.1%, p <0.001), and the presence of active malignancy
(29.5% vs. 12.9%, p 0.004). In the multivariate analysis, higher
Pittsburg bacteraemia score (OR 1.07; 95% CI 1.01-1.14), TTP <7 h (OR
2.46; 95% CI 1.20-5.05) and active malignancy (OR 2.21; 95% CI
1.03-4.73) were the significant factors associated with 30-day
mortality. In the Kaplan-Meier survival curve, short TTP was
significantly associated with mortality at all time-points after
admission. TTP of blood cultures, interpreted with a cut-off point of
<7 h, in patients with K. pneumoniae bacteraemia can provide useful
prognostic information.

AB  - Introduction: Bloodstream infections are one of the leading causes of
mortality and morbidity. Time to positive blood culture may be
reflective of the severity of infection. We aim to study the impact of
time to positivity (TTP) of blood culture upon clinical outcome.
Methods: Data from blood cultures for 17 months duration reviewed.
Outcome measures included in-hospital mortality and length of stay in
ICU (LOSICU). TTP was determined for each sample. Demographics (age,
gender, BMI, and nationality), APACHE-2 score for severity of illness,
comorbid conditions, and other confounding factors were recorded.
Results: One hundred and one patients with 346 positive blood cultures
with mean age of 62 and mean APACHE-2 score of 18.9 + 9.7 (mean +SD)
with overall observed mortality of 61%. Median TTP was 20.2 h with
quartiles cutoff Q1 = 15.3, Q2 = 20.2, Q3 = 28, and range 8–104 h.
Only APACHE-2 scores predict LOSICU. TTP is not a significant
predictor for mortality or LOSICU. Discussion: Data on TTP of blood
cultures have a complex interaction with clinical outcomes.
Conclusion: TTP of blood cultures does not predict mortality or length
of stay in ICU.

AB  - Abstract The time to positivity (TTP) of blood cultures has been
considered a predictor of clinical outcomes for bacteremia. This
retrospective study aimed to determine the clinical value of TTP for
the prognostic assessment of patients with Escherichia coli
bacteremia. A total of 167 adult patients with E.coli bacteremia
identified over a 22-month period in a 3500-bed university teaching
hospital in China were studied. The standard cut-off TTP was 11 h in
the patient cohort. The septic shock occurred in 27.9% of patients
with early TTP (⩽11 h) and in 7.1% of those with a prolonged TTP (>11
h) (P = 0.003). The mortality rate was significantly higher for
patients in the early than in the late group (17.7% vs. 4.0%, P <
0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that an early TTP (OR 4.50, 95%
CI 1.70–11.93), intensive care unit admission (OR 8.39, 95% CI
2.01–35.14) and neutropenia (OR 4.20, 95% CI 1.55–11.40) were
independently associated with septic shock. Likewise, the independent
risk factors for mortality of patients were an early TTP (OR 3.80, 95%
CI 1.04–12.90), intensive care unit admission (OR 6.45; 95% CI
1.14–36.53), a Pittsburgh bacteremia score ⩾2 (OR 4.34, 95% CI
1.22–15.47) and a Charlson Comorbidity Index ⩾3 (OR 11.29, 95% CI
2.81–45.39). Overall, a TTP for blood cultures within 11 h appears to
be associated with worse outcomes for patients with E.coli bacteremia.

AB  - Background: Appropriate de-escalation of empirical antimicrobial
therapy is a fundamental component of antimicrobial stewardship.
Concern for the late detection of bloodstream pathogens may undermine
early streamlining efforts and subject patients to protracted courses
of nonessential therapy. Objective: To quantify the prevalence of
bacterial bloodstream infection (BSI) detection after more than 48
hours of culture incubation. We also assessed the impact of
antimicrobial therapy delivered prior to blood sample collection.
Methods: We retrospectively evaluated time to blood culture positivity
(TTP) in adult patients at an academic tertiary care hospital.
Microbiology reports were reviewed to identify the TTP for the first
positive blood culture bottle for each episode of BSI occurring from
February 1, 2011, to July 31, 2011. Isolates were classified as true
pathogens or contaminants. Blood culture results after 48 hours of
incubation were compared with results after 120 hours of incubation.
Results: The median TTP of 416 monomicrobial BSIs and 210
contamination episodes was 13.7 and 24.4 hours, respectively (P <
.001). The median TTPs in those who received and did not receive prior
antibiotics were 17.0 and 12.8 hours, respectively (P < .001). By 48
hours, 98% of aerobic Gram-positive and Gram-negative BSIs were
detected. Culture results at 48 hours were 97% sensitive and had a
negative predictive value of 99.8%. Conclusion: Few true BSIs are
detected after more than 48 hours of culture incubation. Clinicians
may adjust empirical antibiotic coverage at this time with little risk
for subsequent bacterial pathogen detection.

AB  - Time to positivity (TTP) is the delay of time from incubation to blood
culture positivity. Short TTP can predict mortality and source of
infection. The aim of this study was to investigate the value of TTP
of patients with bloodstream infections with enterococci (E-BSI).In a
single centre retrospective cohort study in Germany, the data of 244
patients with monomicrobial E-BSI were analyzed with hospital
mortality as the primary outcome of interest from January 1 2014 to
December 31 2016. Mortality rate of patients with bloodstream
infections (BSI) with E. faecalis was 16.7%, Vancomycin sensitive E.
faecium (VSEfm) 26.7% and Vancomycin resistant E. faecium (VREfm)
38.2%. Cut-offs showed a significantly higher mortality rate when
compared to longer TTP (E. faecalis: P=0.047; VSEfm: P=0.02), but were
not risk factors in survival analysis (E.faecalis: HR (hazard ratio):
2.73; P=0.17; VSEfm: HR: 1.63; P=0.15; VREfm: HR: 1.24; P=0.63).
TTP≤10.5 hours with E. faecalis BSI was a discriminator for
cardiovascular source of infection (AUC: 0.75). A short TTP could
predict mortality rates and source of infection but was not an
independent parameter for risk of death in survival analysis.

AB  - PURPOSE

To examine the effect of inappropriate initial antimicrobial therapy
on the prognosis of patients with sepsis who were enrolled in a
clinical trial of an immunomodulating agent conducted in 108 hospitals
in North America and Europe.

METHODS

We assessed initial antimicrobial choice and results of microbiologic
cultures in 904 patients who had microbiologically confirmed severe
sepsis or early septic shock. If a patient did not receive at least
one antimicrobial agent to which the causative microorganisms were
susceptible within 24 hours from the diagnosis of severe sepsis, then
the initial antimicrobial treatment was considered to be
inappropriate. A propensity score that adjusted for factors associated
with inappropriate antimicrobial treatment was calculated and included
in multivariable models to adjust for confounding.

RESULTS

A total of 468 patients (52%) had documented bloodstream infection,
and 211 patients (23%) received inappropriate initial antimicrobial
therapy. Characteristics associated with inappropriate treatment were
study enrollment in Europe, admission to surgery, nosocomial
infection, infection with multiresistant microorganisms, and fungal or
polymicrobial infection (all P <0.05). The 28-day mortality was 24%
(168/693) for patients in the adequately treated group versus 39%
(82/211) for patients receiving inappropriate initial antimicrobial
therapy (P <0.001). After adjusting for comorbid conditions, severity
of illness, site of infection, and the propensity score, inappropriate
antimicrobial therapy was independently associated with increased
mortality (odds ratio = 1.8; 95% confidence interval: 1.2 to 2.6).

CONCLUSION

In a large cohort of patients with microbiologically confirmed severe
sepsis, appropriate initial antimicrobial therapy was an important
determinant of survival. New approaches aimed at improving detection
and treatment of early sepsis are needed.

AB  - Background

Elderly patients with intra-abdominal infection are more vulnerable to
sepsis progression, especially in those who had concomitant
bacteremia. The time to positivity (TTP) of blood cultures in patients
with bacteremia is considered to be a prognostic factor for some
bacterial species. This study aimed to investigate the prognostic
value of TTP in elderly patients with intra-abdominal infection and
Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia.

Methods

A retrospective observational, case-control study was conducted at a
single tertiary referral medical center. All elderly (aged ≥ 65 years)
patients diagnosed with intra-abdominal infection and Klebsiella
pneumoniae bacteremia in the emergency department between July 1,
2016, and June 30, 2021 were enrolled. The baseline characteristics,
TTP of blood cultures, management strategy, and outcomes of each
eligible patient were recorded and analyzed. The primary outcome was
to examine the association between TTP and the 30-day mortality risk
in enrolled patients.

Results

A total of 101 patients were included in the study. The overall 30-day
mortality rate was 11.9% (12/101). The median TTP of Klebsiella
pneumoniae in the eligible patients was 12.5 (11-16) hours. There was
a stepwise significantly decreased mortality rate as TTP increased (p
= 0.04). The TTP had a moderate mortality discrimination ability (area
under receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.75, 95% CI =
0.65-0.83, p < 0.01). Furthermore, the Pittsburg bacteremia score
(hazard ratio [HR] = 2.19, p < 0.01) and TTP (HR = 0.82, p = 0.04)
were identified as independent factors associated with 30-day
mortality.

Conclusions

TTP was associated with 30-day mortality risk in elderly patients with
Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia and intra-abdominal infection.
Clinicians can utilize TTP for risk stratification, and initiate
prompt treatment in those patients with shorter TTP.

AB  - BACKGROUND

Complications of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) are often
difficult to identify. The ability to accurately predict the
likelihood of these complications would impact patient management.
This investigation sought to define readily available clinical
characteristics that could help identify patients at risk for
complicated SAB.

METHODS

A prospective, observational cohort study was conducted from September
1994 through December 1999. Patients were followed up for 12 weeks
after the initial positive blood culture result. The primary end point
was complicated SAB (attributable mortality, complicated infection,
embolic stroke, or recurrent S aureus infection during the 12-week
follow-up period). The predictive model was validated using bootstrap
resampling.

RESULTS

Complicated SAB was present in 43% of 724 consecutive adult
hospitalized patients identified during the study period. The full
predictive model had a high discriminative ability
(bootstrap-corrected c index, 0.78). The strongest predictor of
complicated SAB was a positive follow-up blood culture result at 48 to
96 hours. A scoring system based on the presence or absence of 4 risk
factors (community acquisition, skin examination findings suggesting
acute systemic infection, persistent fever at 72 hours, and positive
follow-up blood culture results at 48-96 hours) accurately identified
complicated SAB (bootstrap-corrected c index, 0.76).

CONCLUSION

Readily available clinical variables can help identify patients at
risk for complicated SAB.

AB  - OBJECTIVES

Short time to positivity (TTP) has been proposed as a prognostic
indicator in bloodstream infection (BSI) but results have been
conflicting. The aim of this study was to explore the association
between TTP and disease severity, using non-linear models.

METHODS

This population-based retrospective study included all blood cultures
in southern Sweden from 2021 to 2023. Using healthcare databases, BSI
episodes were linked to information regarding prespecified disease
severity markers at the time of culture (laboratory values and vital
signs) as well as patient outcomes (intensive care admission and
all-cause mortality at 30 days). The associations between TTP vs.
disease severity were explored using non-linear regression models.

RESULTS

The study included 12 585 unique BSI episodes, with a median
(interquartile range) TTP of 12.1 (9.7-17.7) hours, and an overall
30-day mortality rate of 14.4%. Non-linear regression models indicated
a higher mortality rate with shorter TTP, with a mortality rate of 20%
at a TTP of 6 hours, and 30% at a TTP of 3 hours. In Enterobacterales,
beta-haemolytic streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus
aureus, as well as in polymicrobial findings, regression models
indicated that shorter TTP was associated with a risk of >30% of
intensive care admission or mortality, as compared with an overall
rate of 18.2%. Shorter TTP was also associated with laboratory values
and vital signs. For lactate, with an overall median value of 1.9
mmol/L, the model indicated a value of 3 mmol/L at a TTP of 8 hours,
and at 4 mmol/L at a TTP of 4 hours. All associations with disease
severity markers and outcomes were non-linear.

DISCUSSION

TTP is an indicator of disease severity and prognosis in BSIs. The
exponential association provides a biologically plausible explanation
for previously conflicting results. Future studies should focus on
determining the clinical utility of TTP.

AB  - PURPOSE

Time to positivity (TTP) has been used in recent years as a simple and
rapid method for the additional characterization of the degree of
bacteremia. However, prognostic factors for TTP in cancer patients
with bloodstream infections have rarely been studied. The aim of this
study was to investigate the clinical factors for TTP involving
various isolated organisms in cancer patients.

METHODS

We analyzed 386 episodes of bloodstream infections (BSIs) in patients
with or without cancer during a 19 month period. Information on age,
gender, tumor type, ICU stay, organisms, multidrug resistance (MDR),
TTP and outcome was collected. Multivariate logistic regression
analysis was performed.

RESULTS

The mean TTP of Enterobacteriaceae in patients with hepatocellular
carcinoma, gastroenterological cancer, and lung cancer was shorter
than in non-cancer patients (9.86 ± 3.22, 10.05 ± 3.47, 8.85 ± 2.78 vs
13.11 ± 5.37 h). The mean TTP of nonfermentative bacilli in patients
with lung cancer (12.37 ± 5.96 h) and hematologic diseases
(8.72 ± 4.21 h) was also shorter than in non-cancer patients
(20.74 ± 2.46 h), and the mean TTP of Staphylococcus isolates was
significantly different between non-cancer patients (22.06 ± 3.71 h)
and hematologic disease patients (11.93 ± 5.44 h). The presence of a
benign tumor was a significant prognostic factor for a long TTP only
in the Staphylococci group (OR 0.076, 95 % CI 0.014-0.412), according
to multivariate analysis. MDR (OR 2.178, 95 % CI 1.196-4.239) was an
independent significant predictor in the Enterobacteriaceae group,
with a short TTP, and it was also a significant clinical factor for a
long TTP in nonfermentative bacilli and the Staphylococci group (OR
5.037, 95 % CI 1.065-23.82; OR 0.167, 95 % CI 0.059-0.474).

CONCLUSION

Time to positivity provides useful diagnostic and prognostic
information for the differentiation of frequently isolated organisms.
This information may help clinicians to use the correct antibiotics in
a timely manner to treat cancer patients with BSIs based on clinical
factor analysis.

AB  - Abstract Background previous studies have established that bacterial
blood concentration is related with clinical outcome. Time to
positivity of blood cultures (TTP) has relationship with bacterial
blood concentration and could be related with prognosis. As there is
scarce information about the usefulness of TTP, we study the
relationship of TTP with clinical parameters in patients with
Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteremia. Methods TTP of all cases of
Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteremia, detected between January 1995 and
December 2004 using the BacT/Alert automated blood culture system in a
teaching community hospital was analyzed. When multiple cultures were
positive only the shortest TTP was selected for the analysis. Results
in the study period 105 patients with Streptococcus pneumoniae
bacteremia were detected. Median TTP was 14.1 hours (range 1.2 h to
127 h). Immunosuppressed patients (n = 5), patients with confusion (n
= 19), severe sepsis or shock at the time of blood culture extraction
(n = 12), those with a diagnosis of meningitis (n = 7) and those
admitted to the ICU (n = 14) had lower TTP. Patients with TTP in the
first quartile were more frequently hospitalized, admitted to the ICU,
had meningitis, a non-pneumonic origin of the bacteremia, and a higher
number of positive blood cultures than patients with TTP in the fourth
quartile. None of the patients with TTP in the 90 th decile had any of
these factors associated with shorter TTP, and eight out of ten
patients with TTP in the 10 th decile had at least one of these
factors. The number of positive blood cultures had an inverse
correlation with TTP, suggesting a relationship of TTP with bacterial
blood concentration. Conclusion Our data support the relationship of
TTP with several clinical parameters in patients with Streptococcus
pneumoniae bacteremia, and its potential usefulness as a surrogate
marker of outcome.

AB  - BACKGROUND

Patients with intra-abdominal sepsis and associated bacteremia have a
high mortality rate. However, outcomes studies in this population are
limited, in part because of the small numbers of such patients. The
objective of this study was to describe characteristics of critically
ill patients with secondary blood stream infection (BSI) of
intra-abdominal origin and identify predictors of mortality.

METHODS

This retrospective, single-center study evaluated patients admitted
between January 2005 and January 2011 with bacteremia because of an
intra-abdominal source. Patients were included if they met criteria
for severe sepsis based on International Classification of Diseases,
9th Revision (ICD 9) codes for acute organ dysfunction, had a positive
blood culture, had at least one ICD 9 code indicative of an
intra-abdominal process, and had a confirmed or clinically suspected
intra-abdominal infection (IAI) within 72 h of the blood culture.
Chart review was performed to confirm the presence of these criteria
and also the absence of any other potential source of bacteremia. Data
were collected on patient demographics, BSI source, source control
procedure details, microorganisms isolated, and antibiotics
administered. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed
to identify independent predictors of mortality.

RESULTS

Three hundred six patients with BSI were identified, of which 108
episodes were deemed to be of intra-abdominal origin. Gram-negative
organisms comprised 43% of blood isolates, followed by gram-positives
(33%), anaerobes (14%), and yeast (9%). Appropriate antimicrobial
therapy was administered in 71% of patients. The overall mortality
rate was 27.8%. As compared with survivors, non-survivors were older,
more likely to have underlying COPD or asthma, and have renal or
metabolic failure (p<0.05 for all). Among non-survivors, adequate
source control was obtained less frequently (64% vs. 91%, p=0.002) and
median time to appropriate antibiotics was longer (23 h vs. 4 h,
p=0.004). Logistic regression analysis revealed inadequate source
control (p=0.002) and inappropriate antibiotics (p=0.016) to be
independently associated with mortality.

CONCLUSIONS

Critically ill patients with a BSI of abdominal origin are at high
risk for mortality. Failure to achieve adequate source control and
administration of inappropriate antibiotics were independent
predictors of mortality. Thus, these represent potential opportunities
to impact outcomes in patients with complicated IAI.

AB  - BACKGROUND

Differential time to positivity (DTP), typically defined as pathogen
growth at least two hours earlier from catheter vs paired peripheral
blood cultures, is sometimes used to diagnose central line associated
bloodstream infections (CLABSIs). Previous studies assessing DTP,
however, have been small, provided conflicting results, and have not
assessed heterogeneity across important subgroups.

METHODS

We conducted a systematic review of the diagnostic characteristics of
DTP for CLABSI, using MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL, LILACS,
AMED and the Cochrane database. Studies were eligible for inclusion if
they reported sensitivities, specificities, predictive values,
likelihood ratios, or 2x2 tables of DTP for diagnosing CLABSI.
Extracted data were analyzed by creating forest plots, performing
bivariate model meta-analysis, and assessing quality using QUADAS-2.

RESULTS

Our search identified 274 records of which 23 met criteria for
meta-analysis. Among 2,526 suspected CLABSIs, DTP demonstrated a
summary sensitivity of 81.3% (95% CI 72.8-87.7%), specificity of 91.8%
(95% CI 84.5-95.8%), positive likelihood ratio of 9.89 (95% CI
5.14-19.00), and negative likelihood ratio of 0.20 (95% CI 0.14-0.30).
Covariate analysis based on catheter duration, study design, and
patient immune status demonstrated no significant differences.
However, DTP performed worse for Staphylococcus aureus (low
sensitivity but high specificity) and Candida (high sensitivity but
low specificity) compared to other organisms.

CONCLUSION

DTP performs well in ruling CLABSIs in or out. Obtaining paired
catheter and peripheral blood cultures for DTP when the infectious
source is unclear may prevent unnecessary line removal and diagnostic
tests, although this needs to be balanced against potentially higher
contamination rates from catheter cultures.

AB  - OBJECTIVES

We aimed to describe the current time-to-positivity (TTP) of blood
cultures in individuals with onco-haematological diseases with febrile
neutropenia. We assessed the probability of having a
multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli (MDR-GNB) bloodstream
infection (BSI) 24 h after cultures were taken, to use this
information for antibiotic de-escalation strategies.

METHODS

BSI episodes were prospectively collected (2003-2017). When a patient
experienced more than one BSI, only one episode was randomly chosen.
Time elapsed from the beginning of incubation to a positive reading
was observed; TTP was recorded when the first bottle had a positive
result.

RESULTS

Of the 850 patient-unique episodes, 323 (38%) occurred in acute
leukaemia, 185 (21.8%) in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and 144 (16.9%) in
solid neoplasms. Coagulase-negative staphylococci (225; 26.5%),
Escherichia coli (207; 26.1%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (136; 16%),
Enterococcus spp. (81; 9.5%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (67; 7.9%),
were the most frequent microorganisms isolated. MDR-GNB were
documented in 126 (14.8%) episodes. Median TTP was 12 h (interquartile
range 9-16.5 h). Within the first 24 h, 92.1% of blood cultures were
positive (783/850). No MDR-GNB was positive over 24 h. Of the 67
(7.9%) episodes with a TTP ≥24 h, 25 (37.3%) occurred in patients who
were already receiving active antibiotics against the isolated
pathogen. Most common isolations with TTP ≥24 h were
coagulase-negative staphylococci, candidaemia and a group of anaerobic
GNB.

CONCLUSIONS

Currently, the vast majority of BSI in individuals with
onco-haematological diseases with febrile neutropenia have a TTP
<24 h, including all episodes caused by MDR-GNB. Our results support
reassessing empiric antibiotic treatment in neutropenic patients at
24 h, to apply antibiotic stewardship de-escalation strategies.

AB  - Abstract Background We aimed to determine the factors associated with
sequential blood culture time to positivity (STTP) and validate the
previously defined time to positivity (TTP) ratio threshold of 1.5 in
predicting adverse disease outcomes and mortality of Staphylococcus
aureus bacteremia (SAB). Methods We conducted an observational study
of adult patients with SAB. The TTP ratio was calculated by dividing
the TTP of the second blood culture by that of the first. Results Of
186 patients, 69 (37%) were female, with a mean age of 63.6 years.
Median TTP was 12 hours (interquartile range [IQR], 10–15 hours) from
the initial and 21 hours (17–29) from sequential blood cultures.
Methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA)–infected patients had
significantly shorter STTPs (P < .001) and lower TTP ratios (P < .001)
compared to patients with methicillin-susceptible S aureus (MSSA). A
significant correlation between initial and STTP was observed in
patients with MRSA (r = 0.42, P = .002) but not in those with MSSA. A
higher rate of native valve endocarditis (NVE) significantly
correlated with a TTP ratio of ≤1.5 (odds ratio, 2.65 [95% confidence
interval, 1.3–5.6]; P = .01). The subgroup having an initial TTP <12
hours combined with a TTP ratio ≤1.5 showed the highest prevalence of
NVE. Conclusions The STTP varies based on methicillin susceptibility
of S aureus isolate. This study suggests a potential clinical utility
of the STTP to identify patients at a higher risk of NVE. However,
prospective studies are required to validate these findings.

AB  - Abstract Time-to-positivity (TTP) may assist in predicting the outcome
of candidaemia. We analysed a candidaemia dataset collected
prospectively in Australia over 1 year (2014–2015). TTP was defined as
the period from blood culture sampling to the blood culture flagging
positive. Of 415 candidaemia episodes, overall, 30-day mortality was
29% (120/415); mortality with Candida albicans was 35% (59/169), C.
glabrata complex, 37% (43/115), C. tropicalis, 43% (10/23), Pichia
kudriavzevii 25% (3/12), and C. parapsilosis complex 7% (5/71). Each
day of increased TTP multiplied the odds ratio (OR) of survival at 30
days by a factor of 1.32 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06–1.69].
Shorter TTP was associated with increased mortality, with 1-day TTP
associated with 30-day mortality 37% (41/112) (95%CI: 28%–46%) and
5-day TTP 11% (2/18) (95%CI: 2%–36%).

AB  - Abstract Background Streptococcus pyogenes bacteremia is a severe
condition with high mortality. Time to blood culture positivity (TTP)
is known to predict the outcome in bacteremia with other pathogens.
This study aimed to determine the association between TTP and outcome
in S pyogenes bacteremia. Methods This retrospective observational
cohort study comprised adults with S pyogenes bacteremia, identified
through the laboratory database between 2015 and 2018, in the Region
of Skåne, Sweden. Correlations between TTP and outcomes were
investigated. Primary outcome was death within 30 days, and secondary
outcomes were presence of sepsis or disease deterioration within the
first 48 hours. Results A total of 347 episodes of S pyogenes
bacteremia were identified, of which 61 were excluded, resulting in
286 included episodes. Median TTP was 10.4 (interquartile range,
8.4–11.4) hours. Thirty-day mortality was 10%. Median TTP was shorter
in patients who died within 30 days compared to survivors (8.6 vs 10.4
hours; P < .001). In a multivariable logistic regression, shorter TTP
was associated with 30-day mortality when adjusting for age, Charlson
Comorbidity Index, and focus of infection (odds ratio, 3.7 [95%
confidence interval, 1.2–11.3]; P = .02). There was no statistically
significant difference in TTP between patients with sepsis within 48
hours and those who did not have sepsis. Additionally, there was no
statistically significant difference in TTP between patients with
disease deterioration compared to those who did not deteriorate.
Conclusions Knowledge on TTP might be a tool to determine the
prognosis of a given patient with S pyogenes bacteremia.

AB  - ABSTRACT Klebsiella pneumoniae is a common causative pathogen of
intra-abdominal infection with concomitant bacteraemia, leading to a
significant mortality risk. The time to positivity (TTP) of blood
culture is postulated to be a prognostic factor in bacteraemia caused
by other species. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the
prognostic value of TTP in these patients. The single-centred,
retrospective, observational cohort study was conducted between 1 July
2016 and 30 June 2021. All adult emergency department patients with
diagnosis of intra-abdominal infection and underwent blood culture
collection which yield K. pneumoniae during this period were enrolled.
A total of 196 patients were included in the study. The overall 30-day
mortality rate was 12.2% (24/196), and the median TTP of the studied
cohort was 12.3 h (10.5–15.8 h). TTP revealed a moderate 30-day
mortality discriminative ability (area under the curve 0.73,
p < 0.001). Compared with the late TTP group (>12 h, N = 109),
patients in the early TTP (≤12 h, N = 87) group had a significantly
higher risk of 30-day morality (21.8% vs. 4.6%, p < 0.01) and other
adverse outcomes. Furthermore, TTP (odds ratio [OR] = 0.79, p = 0.02),
Pitt bacteraemia score (OR = 1.30, p = 0.03), and implementation of
source control (OR = 0.06, p < 0.01) were identified as independent
factors related to 30-day mortality risk in patients with
intra-abdominal infection and K. pneumoniae bacteraemia. Therefore,
physicians can use TTP for prognosis stratification in these patients.

AB  - Abstract Introduction The optimal duration of antibiotic therapy for
bloodstream infections is unknown. Shorter durations of therapy have
been demonstrated to be as effective as longer durations for many
common infections; similar findings in bacteremia could enable
hospitals to reduce antibiotic utilization, adverse events, resistance
and costs. Methods A search of the MEDLINE, EMBASE and COCHRANE
databases was conducted for the years 1947-2010. Controlled trials
were identified that randomized patients to shorter versus longer
durations of treatment for bacteremia, or the infectious foci most
commonly causing bacteremia in critically ill patients
(catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI), intra-abdominal
infections, pneumonia, pyelonephritis and skin and soft-tissue
infections (SSTI)). Results Twenty-four eligible trials were
identified, including one trial focusing exclusively on bacteremia,
zero in catheter related bloodstream infection, three in
intra-abdominal infection, six in pyelonephritis, thirteen in
pneumonia and one in skin and soft tissue infection. Thirteen studies
reported on 227 patients with bacteremia allocated to 'shorter' or
'longer' durations of treatment. Outcome data were available for 155
bacteremic patients: neonatal bacteremia ( n = 66); intra-abdominal
infection (40); pyelonephritis (9); and pneumonia (40). Among
bacteremic patients receiving shorter (5-7 days) versus longer (7-21
days) antibiotic therapy, no significant difference was detected with
respect to rates of clinical cure (45/52 versus 47/49, risk ratio
0.88, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.77-1.01), microbiologic cure
(28/28 versus 30/32, risk ratio 1.05, 95% CI 0.91-1.21), and survival
(15/17 versus 26/29, risk ratio 0.97, 95% CI 0.76-1.23). Conclusions
No significant differences in clinical cure, microbiologic cure and
survival were detected among bacteremic patients receiving shorter
versus longer duration antibiotic therapy. An adequately powered
randomized trial of bacteremic patients is needed to confirm these
findings.

AB  - Background/Aims The high mortality attributable to persistent
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia in spite
of glycopeptide treatment has heightened the need for early detection
and intervention with alternative agents. The purpose of this study
was to determine the clinical characteristics of and risk factors for
persistent MRSA bacteremia. Methods All first episodes of significant
MRSA bacteremia at a 710-bed academic medical center from November
2009 through August 2010 were recorded. Blood cultures were conducted
at 3 days and every 2 to 3 days thereafter until clearance. Clinical
characteristics and outcomes were compared between persistent MRSA
bacteremia (≥ 7 days) and nonpersistent MRSA bacteremia (≤ 3 days).
Results Of 79 patients with MRSA bacteremia during the study period,
31 (39.2%) had persistent MRSA bacteremia. The persistent MRSA
bacteremia group had significantly higher 30-day mortality than the
nonpersistent MRSA bacteremia group (58.1% vs. 16.7%, p < 0.001).
Multivariate analysis indicated that metastatic infection at
presentation (odds ratio [OR], 14.57; 95% confidence interval [CI],
3.52 to 60.34; p < 0.001) and delayed catheter removal in
catheter-related infection (OR, 3.80; 95% CI, 1.04 to 13.88; p =
0.004) were independent predictors of persistent MRSA bacteremia.
Patients with a time to blood culture positivity (TTP) of < 11.8 hours
were at increased risk of persistent MRSA bacteremia (29.0% vs. 8.3%,
p = 0.029). Conclusions High mortality in patients with persistent
MRSA bacteremia was noted. Early detection of metastatic infection and
early removal of infected intravascular catheters should be considered
to reduce the risk of persistent MRSA bacteremia. Further studies are
needed to evaluate the role of TTP for predicting persistent MRSA
bacteremia.

AB  - ABSTRACT Candida spp. are important causes of nosocomial bloodstream
infections. Around 80% of patients with candidemia have an indwelling
central venous catheter (CVC). Determining whether the CVC is the
source of candidemia has implications for patient management. We
assessed whether the time to detection of Candida species in
peripheral blood (time to positivity [TTP]) can serve as a marker for
catheter-related candidemia. Prospective surveillance of Candida
bloodstream infection was conducted in two medical centers. TTP was
recorded by the BacT/Alert automated system. Sixty-four candidemia
episodes were included. Fifty patients (78%) had an indwelling CVC.
Thirteen patients (20.3%) had definite catheter-related candidemia.
TTP was shorter for definite catheter-related candidemia (17.3 ± 2 h)
than that for candidemia from other sources (38.2 ± 3 h; P < 0.001). A
TTP cutoff of 30 h was 100% sensitive and 51.4% specific for
catheter-related candidemia (area under the receiver-operator
characteristic curve of 0.76). We conclude that TTP in peripheral
blood is a sensitive but nonspecific marker for catheter-related
candidemia and that a TTP of more than 30 h can help exclude an
intravascular catheter as the possible source of candidemia.

AB  - BACKGROUND

The causes of persistent bacteremia (PB) due to methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are poorly understood. This investigation
examined potential associations between PB with key clinical features
and several in vitro bacterial genotypic and phenotypic
characteristics, in isolates from 1 institution.

METHODS

Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) relatedness, thrombin-induced
platelet microbicidal protein (tPMP)-susceptibility phenotype,
accessory gene regulator (agr) genotype and functionality (via
delta-lysin production), and autolysis phenotypes were assessed in
MRSA isolates from the bloodstream of 21 prospectively identified
patients with PB (blood cultures positive after > or =7 days of
therapy) and of 18 patients with resolving bacteremia (RB) (sterile
blood cultures within the first 2-4 days of therapy) due to MRSA.

RESULTS

The 2 groups had comparable baseline characteristics but differed in
their clinical courses (e.g., endocarditis was more frequent in
patients with PB than in those with RB [43% vs. 0%, respectively;
P=.0016]); isolates from patients with PB exhibited higher rates of
(1) survival in vitro after exposure to tPMP (22.4+/-14.8% vs.
11.6+/-6.5%, respectively; P=.005); (2) defective delta-lysin
production (71.4% vs. 38.9%, respectively; P=.057); (3) non-agr
genotype II profile (100% vs. 77.8%, respectively; P=.037); and (4)
overrepresentation of a specific PFGE genotype (85.7% vs. 44.4%,
respectively; P=.015).

CONCLUSIONS

Isolates from patients with PB differed from those in patients with
RB, in several in vitro characteristics. Further studies will be
necessary to define how these factors might affect clinical outcome.

Persistent infection is not a scientific evidence-based definition.
The guidelines of infective endocarditis (IE) establish a cut-off
point of 7-10 days, which is arbitrary and probably too long. Our
hypothesis is that persistent positive blood cultures after 48-72 h
from the initiation of antibiotic therapy are associated with a worse
prognosis in patients with left-sided IE.

METHODS AND RESULTS

We repeated blood cultures after 48-72 h of the initiation of the
antibiotic treatment in 407 patients with left-sided IE of a total of
692 episodes consecutively diagnosed from 1996 to 2011. We have
compared the profile of patients whose blood cultures became negative
and those with persistent positive blood cultures. We performed a
multivariate logistic regression model to determine the prognostic
implication of persistent positive blood cultures. Of 256 patients
with positive blood cultures at admission, 89 (35%) had persistent
positive cultures after 48-72 h from the initiation of the antibiotic
treatment. Persistent positive blood cultures (OR: 2.1; 95% CI:
1.2-3.6), age (OR: 1.026; 95% CI: 1.007-1.046), Staphylococcus aureus
infection (OR: 3.3; 95% CI: 1.6-6.6), heart failure (OR: 2.8; 95% CI:
1.6-4.7), and renal failure (OR: 2.9; 95% CI: 1.8-4.9) were found to
be independently associated with higher in-hospital mortality.

CONCLUSIONS

The presence of persistent positive blood cultures is an independent
risk factor for in-hospital mortality which doubles the risk of death
of patients with left-sided IE. It should be taken into account in the
risk stratification of these patients.

AB  - Abstract Purpose Invasive infections with Streptococcus dysgalactiae
predominantly occur in persons of older age with substantial morbidity
and mortality. Time to positivity from blood cultures (TTP) has been
shown to be a prognostic indicator in bloodstream infections caused by
other beta-haemolytic streptococci. This study aimed to determine any
possible association between TTP and outcome in invasive infections
due to S. dysgalactiae. Materials and methods Episodes of S.
dysgalactiae bacteraemia, that occurred during 2015–2018 in the Region
of Skåne, Sweden, were identified through the laboratory database and
retrospectively studied. Any association with TTP and the primary
outcome, death within 30 days and the development of sepsis or disease
deterioration within 48 hours from blood culturing as secondary
outcomes were investigated. Results Among the 287 episodes of S.
dysgalactiae bacteraemia, 30-day mortality rate was 10% (n = 30).
Median TTP was 9.3 h (interquartile range 8.0–10.3 h). Median TTP was
statistically significantly shorter in patients who died within
30 days compared to surviving patients (7.7 vs 9.3 h, p = .001,
Mann–Whitney U test). Short TTP(≤ 7.9 h) was still associated with
30-day mortality when adjusting for age, (OR 4.4, 95% CI 1.6–12.2,
p = .004). Associations between secondary outcomes and levels of TTP
were not observed. Conclusion TTP may be an important prognostic
indicator for 30-day mortality in patients with bloodstream infections
due to S. dysgalactiae.

AB  - The time to positivity (TTP) of blood cultures has been considered a
predictor of clinical outcomes for bacteremia. This retrospective
study aimed to determine the clinical value of TTP for the prognostic
assessment of patients with Escherichia coli bacteremia. A total of
167 adult patients with E.coli bacteremia identified over a 22-month
period in a 3500-bed university teaching hospital in China were
studied. The standard cut-off TTP was 11 h in the patient cohort. The
septic shock occurred in 27.9% of patients with early TTP (⩽11 h) and
in 7.1% of those with a prolonged TTP (>11 h) (P = 0.003). The
mortality rate was significantly higher for patients in the early than
in the late group (17.7% vs. 4.0%, P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis
showed that an early TTP (OR 4.50, 95% CI 1.70–11.93), intensive care
unit admission (OR 8.39, 95% CI 2.01–35.14) and neutropenia (OR 4.20,
95% CI 1.55–11.40) were independently associated with septic shock.
Likewise, the independent risk factors for mortality of patients were
an early TTP (OR 3.80, 95% CI 1.04–12.90), intensive care unit
admission (OR 6.45; 95% CI 1.14–36.53), a Pittsburgh bacteremia score
⩾2 (OR 4.34, 95% CI 1.22–15.47) and a Charlson Comorbidity Index ⩾3
(OR 11.29, 95% CI 2.81–45.39). Overall, a TTP for blood cultures
within 11 h appears to be associated with worse outcomes for patients
with E.coli bacteremia. Escherichia coli bacteremia is a common
clinical presentation that may at times be transient but on occasion,
can lead to septic shock or even death [1]. Established risk factors
for mortality include underlying diseases, the severity of systemic
inflammatory response syndrome, inadequate antibiotic treatment,
nosocomial acquisition, age over 65 years, non-urinary tract source
and multi-drug resistant infections [2, 3]. However, such data and
other sepsis indicators, specifically elevated levels of C-reactive
protein and procalcitonin have limited prognostic precision [4] and
some clinical scoring systems may not provide sufficiently timely data
or may require intricate calculations not readily appropriate for
daily routine use. Therefore, it is very important to identify and
utilise a simple and practical indicator to guide clinical treatment.
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of the
time-to-positive (TTP) interval of blood cultures for patients with
E.coli bacteremia. A retrospective observational study was conducted
from January 2014 to November 2016 at the Xiangya Hospital Central
South University, a 3500-bed comprehensive tertiary hospital located
in Changsha, China. Adult inpatients (⩾18 years old) were considered
eligible if they had a bloodstream infection with one or more blood
culture positive for E.coli. Each patient was included only once at
the time of the first positive blood culture result, but if multiple
blood culture proved positive, the shortest TTP value was recorded.
Patients were excluded if they had polymicrobial infections or were
treated with antimicrobials prior to blood culture. Clinical data
included age, gender, underlying diseases as per the Charlson
Comorbidity Index [5], neutrophil count <1.5 × 10/L, primary site of
E. coli infection prior to, or coincident with, the onset of
bacteremia. The latter was classified as primary in a patient if a
specific body site of the acquisition was not evident [6], they had
previous surgery or interventional therapy during hospitalisation, had
received steroids (prednisolone 10 mg/daily or equivalent dose for a
minimum of 2 weeks) and/or other immunosuppressive therapy within 2
months prior to bacteremia. The adequacy of antimicrobial therapy was
based on in vitro susceptibility of an isolate and whether antibiotic
treatment was started within 24 h after blood cultures were taken. The
Pittsburgh bacteremia score [7], presence of septic shock [8] and
mortality rates were used to assess clinical outcomes. At least two
sets of blood samples, 20ml each, were taken from separate venous
sites and inoculated into aerobic and anaerobic culture bottles. These
were loaded on a BACTEC 9120 automated detection blood culture system
(Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD, USA). All bottles giving a positive
signal were examined by Gram staining, subcultured to blood agar
medium and incubated for 18–48 h. Isolates were identified to species
level and antibiotic susceptibility was determined using the VITEK-2
Compact system(bioMerieux, Marcy L’Etoile, France); susceptibility of
the isolates was determined by the MIC, according to the criteria of
the CLSI [9]. The TTP for each bottle was defined as the time period
from the start of incubation to the alert signal as documented by the
monitoring system. Data analysis was conducted using SPSS for Windows
(version 24, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Normality was checked with
the D’Agostino’s K-squared test. Continuous variables with nonnormal
distribution were presented as medians with inter-quartile ranges
(IQRs) and compared by the Mann–Whitney U-test. Categorical variables,
expressed as numbers and percentages, were compared by the Chi-square
or Fisher’s exact test. The predictive capability of TTP was assessed
by receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) and area under the curve
(AUC) analysis. The maximum Youden’s index [10] was used as a
criterion for selecting the optimum cut-off point for TTP. Univariate
analysis was performed for associations between risk factors, the
incidence of septic shock and in-hospital mortality. Variables with p
< 0.1 in univariate analysis were entered in multivariate logistic
regression models with forward selection. Odds ratio (OR) and
corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated by standard
formulae. During the study period, 167 patients were included, 72
males and 95 females. The average age was 51.2 (20–88) years and 67
(40.1%) patients were older than 65 years. In total, 26 (15.6%)
patients had septic shock and 16 (9.6%) died in the hospital. Relevant
clinical characteristics are shown in Table 1. The median TTP of 167
patients with E. coli bacteremia was 12.5 h (range 1.5 to 78.6 h) and
the 25th and 75th percentiles were 9.1 h and 18.1 h, respectively. By
ROC analysis, the TTP in relation to the occurrence of septic shock
showed a significant AUC of 0.71 (95% CI, 0.61–0.80), indicating a
moderate predictive capability for this condition (Figure 1). By
Youden’s index, 11.42 h was found to be the optimal point for TTP and
so 11 h was used as the standard cut-off; this value had a sensitivity
of 73.1% and a specificity of 65.2% for predicting septic shock.
Patients were therefore divided into early (TTP⩽ 11 h) and late (TTP >
11 h) detection groups. In terms of clinical characteristics and
outcomes of the two TTP groups, patients in the early group had higher
Pittsburgh bacteremia scores (⩾2, 45.6% vs. 21.2%, P = 0.001), a
higher incidence of developing septic shock (27.9% vs. 7.1%, P <
0.001) and significantly higher in-hospital mortality (17.7% vs. 4.0%,
P = 0.003). The median TTP was significantly shorter for patients with
septic shock than for those without it (10.30 h, range 3.15–20.30 h
vs. 16.60 h, range 1.50–78.63 h; P = 0.001). Likewise, multivariable
logistic regression analysis demonstrated that septic shock was
correlated with neutropenia (OR 4.20 95%CI 1.55–11.40, P = 0.005),
TTP⩽ 11 h (OR 4.50; 95%CI 1.7–11.93, P = 0.03) and admission to
intensive care (OR 8.39; 95% 2.01–35.14, P = 0.004). Regarding
in-hospital mortality, multivariable logistic regression showed that a
Charlson Comorbidity Index ⩾3 (OR 11.29; 95% CI 2.81– 45.39, P =
0.044), TTP⩽ 11 h (OR 3.80; 95% CI 1.04–13.90, P = 0.035), Pittsburgh
bacteremia score ⩾2 (OR 4.34; 95% CI 1.22– 15.47, P = 0.023) and
intensive care unit admission (OR 6.45; 95% CI 1.14–36.53, P = 0.035)
were independent risk factors. E. coli is the most common
Gram-negative organism isolated from patients with community-acquired
or nosocomial bacteraemia [11,12] which can lead to severe morbidity
and mortality. Recently, with the use of automated blood culture
systems, the determination of the TTP for patients’ blood cultures has
been increasingly used as an auxiliary indicator for more precise
diagnosis and guide to treatment [13]. Both the bacterial species and
their cell numbers can affect the TTP result but as the assay more
closely reflects the circulating bacterial load it has the potential
to correlate more closely with clinical severity. Our study aimed to
investigate whether shorter TTP intervals (early positives) for E.
coli bacteremia were associated with specific risk factors and poorer
clinical outcome of patients when compared with patients characterised
by longer TTP intervals (late positives). Analysis of ROC curves is
commonly used to judge the accuracy of diagnostic tests and to
determine the best cut-off value to distinguish between positive and
negative test results. This value is given equal weight to sensitivity
and specificity indices and is expressed as the point nearest to the
top-left most corner of the ROC curve; also known as the Youden Index.
Using this approach, a TTP of 11 h was selected as the standard
cut-off and a value ⩽ 11 h was Table 1. Demographical, clinical

AB  - Abstract Background While numerous studies have investigated the
correlations among time to positivity (TTP) in blood cultures, the
number of positive bottles, and mortality rates, the association with
metastatic lesion formation in Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus)
bacteremia remains poorly understood. This investigation aims to
assess the impact on the severity of the, mortality, and the frequency
of metastatic lesions. Study Population Flowchart Flowchart
illustrating categorization of S. aureus-positive blood culture cases
for assessing TTP, bottle count, severity, mortality, and metastatic
lesions. Methods A retrospective analysis was conducted on patients
over 15 years old, admitted to St. Luke's International Hospital
between 2015 and 2023, who tested positive for S. aureus in blood
cultures. Patients with polymicrobial patterns or transferred within a
week were excluded. Metastatic lesions were identified through chart
reviews and imaging. Baseline Characteristics of Study Participants
Results From 398 initial cases, 317 patients were included after
exclusions (Figure 1). The patient cohort had an average age of 70.3
years (Standard deviation, SD: 17.0), with 62.5% being male, and 22.4%
with MRSA infections. The average TTP was 19.9 hours (SD: 11.9) (Table
1). No significant differences were observed in TTP or bottle count in
relation to mortality or severity. Further investigation into the
relationship with metastatic lesions shown in Table 2 revealed that
TTP for patients with intravascular infections was significantly
shorter, averaging 16.81 hours (SD: 5.68), compared to 23.45 hours
(SD: 13.84) in bacteremia without metastatic lesions. TTP for bone and
joint infections was significantly shorter, averaging 17.88 hours (SD:
8.26), compared to bacteremia without metastatic lesions. SSTI did not
show a significant difference in TTP. A weak correlation was found
between TTP and metastatic lesion counts (r=0.203) (Figure 2).
Additionally, TTP and positive set count showed a weak correlation
(r=0.544). When TTP cannot be determined, bottle counts may offer an
alternative indicator. number of complications due to S. aureus
Conclusion While TTP and bottle count were weakly correlated, they
failed to predict severity or mortality in S. aureus bacteremia.
Positivity within 24 hours warrants further examination for metastatic
conditions like intravascular and bone infections. Yet, TTP and bottle
counts' predictive value for metastatic lesion quantity is minimal,
highlighting the need for thorough physical exams and imaging.

AB  - Data on time-to-positivity (TTP) of blood cultures has been available
for approximately 25 years, due to continuous monitoring blood-culture
instruments. It is defined as the time from the start of incubation to
a positive signal. It has long been recognized to carry useful
information for patient management that is progressively decrypted
with varying degrees of success. First efforts have focused on early
discrimination between bacterial groups or sources of infection. The
TTP has then constituted the basis of the differential TTP method used
to diagnose catheter-related bloodstream infection [[1]Blot F.
Nitenberg G. Chachaty E. Raynard B. Germann N. Antoun S. et
al.Diagnosis of catheter related bacteraemia: a prospective comparison
of the time to positivity of central vs peripheral blood
cultures.Lancet. 1999; 354: 1071-1077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF
PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar]. An increasing interest in TTP is
becoming clear, highlighted by the four-fold increase in publications
on this topic over the past decade. The need to develop early
de-escalation stewardship strategies and the need for better and
prompt identification of patients who should benefit from more
aggressive treatment have promoted research on TTP. Concerning the
potential usefulness of TTP to guide antimicrobial therapy, most works
have addressed onco-haematological patients with febrile neutropenia
[2Puerta-Alcalde P, Cardozo C, Suárez-Lledó M, Rodríguez-Núñez O,

Scholar], probably because these patients combine a high risk of
antimicrobial selective pressure with a high risk of bloodstream
infection. In this issue, Puerta-Alcade et al. advocate, based on a
retrospective study, early de-escalation at 24 h [[2]Puerta-Alcalde P,
Cardozo C, Suárez-Lledó M, Rodríguez-Núñez O, Morata L, Fehér C, et

strategies. Clin Microbiol Infect; Article in Press,
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2018.07.026.Google Scholar] instead of
48–96 h as commonly advised because (i) the great majority of episodes
with positive blood culture are positive within the first 24 h, (ii)
positive episodes with TTP ≥24 h are commonly optimally treated
infections, catheter-related infections, or infections caused by
slowly growing microorganisms such as Candida or anaerobic
Gram-negative bacteria, and (iii) growth of multidrug-resistant
Gram-negative bacilli is exceptional beyond 24 h. With similar
logistics, other studies show short TTP in agreement with
Puerta-Alcade et al.'s results: median TTP, although it varied between
bacterial groups, was ≤24 h except for yeasts (see ref. [[4]Jacobs
M.R. Mazzulli T. Hazen K.C. Good C.E. Abdelhamed A.M. Lo P. et
al.Multicenter clinical evaluation of BacT/Alert Virtuo blood culture
system.J Clin Microbiol. 2017; 55: 2413-2421Crossref PubMed Scopus
(27) Google Scholar]); most TTPs in other patient populations were ≤24
h (see ref. [[5]Dierig A. Berger C. Agyeman P.K.A. Bernhard-Stirnemann
S. Giannoni E. Stocker M. et al.Swiss Pediatric Sepsis Study.
Time-to-positivity of blood cultures in children with sepsis.Front
Pediatr. 2018; 6: 222Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar]).
When combined with rapid antibiotic susceptibility tests and if the
laboratory is open 24 h/day, this is a promising approach to speed up
patient management and reduce antimicrobial selective pressure. Such
an approach contrasts with the '48 rule' based on tradition rather
than strong evidence. However, it is important to keep in mind that
TTP may be difficult to interpret and should be analysed with caution.
From a microbiological standpoint, TTP provides indirect information
on the biomass, which is a function of the bacteraemia load and of the
microbial growth rate: the lower the TTP (i.e. the faster the bottle
shows positive), the higher is the inoculum in the blood and/or the
higher the growth rate. TTP is associated with many other confounding
factors that are usually overlooked in routine practice. Confounding
factors include the volume of blood in the bottles, conditions of
cultures (atmosphere, type of broth), transportation time, a
concomitant antimicrobial therapy, or the type of sample (venepuncture
or through a catheter). Very few studies have addressed these points,
but the study by Cobos-Trigueros et al. showed the mixed influence of
logistics (e.g. transportation, laboratory opening hours), broth
media, atmosphere and microorganism species on blood culture TTP of
Candida glabrata. Among other differences, the two centres that
participated in the study loaded bottles either round the clock or
only during laboratory work hours [[6]Cobos-Trigueros N. Kaasch A.J.
Soriano A. Torres J.L. Vergara A. Morata L. et al.Time to positivity
and detection of growth in anaerobic blood culture vials predict the
presence of Candida glabrata in candidemia: a two-center European
cohort study.J Clin Microbiol. 2014; 52: 3082-3084Crossref PubMed
Scopus (18) Google Scholar]. As a result, the median TTP of C.
glabrata substantially differed between the two centres, 56.5 h
(interquartile range 29.7–77.3) and 83 h (interquartile range 46–113),
respectively. Delay of bottle loading is one of the most important
confounding factors because it both increases TTP (due to delay) and
reduces TTP because the bacteria start to grow at room temperature.
Lambregts et al. tried to take into account this point by defining TTP
from the collection time ('TTP sensu latu'), which reflects real life
better than 'TTP sensu strictu' [[3]Lambregts M.M.C. Warreman E.B.
Bernards A.T. Veelken H. von dem Borne P.A. Dekkers O.M. et
al.Distribution and clinical determinants of time-to-positivity of
blood cultures in patients with neutropenia.Eur J Haematol. 2018; 100:
206-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar]. However, external
validity is still hampered, because time to bottle load also widely
varies between institutions. In other aspects, contradictory data were
obtained for patients with catheter-related bloodstream infection,
with either TTP <24 h [[1]Blot F. Nitenberg G. Chachaty E. Raynard B.

be cautious in using the cut-off values defined in single-centre
studies; one should check for consistency in logistics, patient
population and technical characteristics, and not forget that the
cut-off values to de-escalation advocated in studies do not include
time to load. Generally, time between collection and bottle loading—or
time to load—needs to be precisely reported in studies on TTP as well
as other confounders. How to use TTP to predict patient outcome is
less clear and requires further study [7Siméon S. Le Moing V. Tubiana

AB  - BACKGROUND

Persistent Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) is defined based on
varying duration in literature. The primary objective of this large
cohort study was to determine the risk for poor outcomes in relation
to bacteremia duration.

METHODS

This was a multicenter, prospective, observational study of adult,
hospitalized patients with SAB. Medical records were reviewed for
pertinent data. Patients were grouped by bacteremia duration: short
(1-2d), intermediate (3-6d), and prolonged (≥7d) and compared for risk
factors and outcomes.

RESULTS

Of 884 patients, 63% had short, 28% intermediate, and 9% prolonged
bacteremia. Overall mean age was 57y and 70% were male. Prolonged
group had the highest proportion of methicillin-resistant SAB
(p<0.0001). Choice of antibiotic therapy did not significantly affect
bacteremia duration, however time to source control procedure was
delayed in the prolonged and intermediate groups compared to the short
group [3.5d vs 3d vs 1d, p<0.0001]. Metastatic complications (12% vs
23% vs 33%), length of stay (9d vs 12d vs 24d), and 30-day mortality
(5% vs 11% vs 22%) were progressively worse as bacteremia duration
increased (p<0.0001). Every continued day of bacteremia was associated
with RR of death of 1.16 (95% CI 1.10-1.22, p<0.0001), with
significant increase in risk starting at 3 days as determined by ROC
analysis.

CONCLUSIONS

Optimal management of SAB should target bacterial clearance as soon as
possible to minimize incremental risk of mortality with each day of
positive blood culture. Delay in source control but not type of
anti-staphylococcal therapy was significantly associated with
prolonged bacteremia and worse outcomes.

AB  - Background Candida-associated catheter-related bloodstream infections
(CRBSIs) present a significant challenge in clinical settings,
particularly among patients with central venous catheters (CVCs).
Time-to-positivity (TTP) of blood cultures, an indicator of fungal
load, may provide insights into infection prognosis and severity. This
study evaluates the role of TTP in Candida-associated bloodstream
infections and its impact on patient outcomes. Materials and methods
This cross-sectional observational study, conducted from July 2023 to
June 2024 at Saveetha Medical College, involved collecting blood
cultures from intensive care unit (ICU) patients with suspected
candidemia. Blood cultures were processed using the BacT/ALERT 3D
system (bioMérieux, Marcy l'Étoile, France), with TTP recorded for
each Candida-positive culture. Species identification was performed
using MALDI-TOF MS (Bruker Daltonics, Germany). Species-specific
30-day mortality was analyzed to assess the impact of TTP on survival.
Results Of 7447 blood cultures from ICU patients, 2349 were positive,
with a 2.42% prevalence of Candida sp. Among 57 candidemia patients,
the median TTP for deceased patients was 24 hours, compared to 25
hours for survivors (p=0.001). C. auris exhibited the highest
mortality rate (56.25%) with a median TTP of 16.5 hours, whereas C.
albicans had no associated mortality and a median TTP of 28.5 hours.
Shorter TTP was consistently associated with higher mortality across
Candida species. Conclusion This study highlights the prognostic value
of TTP in Candida-associated bloodstream infections, with shorter TTP
correlating with higher mortality. The findings underscore the need
for rapid diagnosis and aggressive treatment, particularly for
high-risk species like C. auris and C. glabrata. Further research is
needed to refine the clinical application of TTP and develop targeted
treatment strategies.

AB  - BACKGROUND

A method of diagnosing catheter-related infection (CRI) without
removing the catheter would be useful. An earlier positivity of
central compared with peripheral venous-blood cultures may be
associated with catheter-related bacteraemia. We evaluated
prospectively the differential time to positivity (DTP) of paired
blood cultures drawn simultaneously via the catheter hub and from a
peripheral venous site.

METHODS

Over a 14-month period in an intensive-care unit of a cancer referral
centre, simultaneous hub-blood and peripheral-blood cultures (a mean
of two per patient) were obtained from patients with a suspected CRI.
According to clinical criteria and quantitative culture of the
catheter tip, cases were classified as CRI or sepsis of other origin.
At least one pair of hub-blood and peripheral-blood cultures was
obtained within 48 h before catheter removal, and we recorded the DTP
between hub-blood and peripheral-blood cultures with an automatic
device for detection of blood culture positivity.

FINDINGS

We analysed 93 catheters removed because of suspicion of CRI. In 28
episodes, the same micro-organisms were found in both hub-blood and
peripheral-blood cultures. A diagnosis of definite bacteraemic CRI was
made in 16 of the 17 patients in whom a positive hub-blood culture was
detected at least 2 hours earlier than peripheral-blood culture. About
half (9/17) of these episodes occurred in long-term (>30 days)
devices. CRI was excluded in ten of the 11 patients with a DTP lower
than 2 h. The DTP of paired blood cultures was significantly greater
in patients with CRI than in others (p<10(-4)). A cut-off DTP value of
120 min had 91% specificity and 94% sensitivity for the diagnosis of
CRI. Three of 17 episodes with only hub-blood culture positive were
associated with CRI.

INTERPRETATION

This prospective study suggests that measurement of the differential
time to positivity between hub-blood and peripheral-blood cultures is
a simple and reliable tool for in-situ diagnosis of catheter-related
sepsis in cancer patients. Further studies are needed to confirm these
data for short-term catheters.

AB  - OBJECTIVES

We investigated the association between patient severity or mortality
and time to positivity in bacteremia caused by various pathogens.

PATIENTS AND METHODS

This single-center retrospective study included patients with positive
blood culture results.

RESULTS

Longer time to positivity was associated with 30-day mortality for
Staphylococcus aureus (221 cases, time to positivity: 17.4 h in the
30-day mortality group vs. 14.1 h in the survival group). Age, chronic
kidney disease, cerebrovascular disease, hypertensive drug use,
consciousness disorder, and minimal systolic blood pressure were
significant predictors of 30-day mortality. For S. aureus, mortality
within 30 days was significantly higher when time to positivity
was > 24 h (p = 0.04). The time to positivity of Streptococcus
pneumoniae, α, β-hemolytic Streptococcus, Enterococcus sp.,
Enterobacteriaceae, glucose-nonfermenting Gram-negative rods, Candida
sp., and anaerobe was not significantly associated with 30-day
mortality.

CONCLUSIONS

Among various pathogens, time to positivity > 24 h was associated with
30-day mortality for S. aureus.

AB  - Blood stream infections (BSI) are one of the serious and life
threatening complications associated with high morbidity and
mortality. Identification of patients without bacterial infections is
an important component of antimicrobial stewardship. With the advances
in the automated blood culture systems especially with the continuous
monitoring systems, time to positivity (TTP) of blood cultures has
been reduced drastically thereby allowing faster de-escalation of the
antibiotics.: In this study, we have analysed the TTP of different
bacterial isolates, and the effects of initiation of antimicrobials
and blood volume on TTP. Adult patients with monomicrobial bacteraemia
in an academic hospital were included retrospectively over a four-year
period. Time to positivity was recorded for each positive sample.
Information about the timing of blood sample collection i.e. before or
after start of antibiotics was collected from the blood culture
requisition form. The blood volume in the blood culture bottle is the
virtual blood volume given by the Bact-Alert Virtuo instrument. A
total of 38,606 blood culture samples that flagged positive from adult
patients with suspected BSIs were included. 79% of the samples had a
TTP of less than 24 hours and 15% of the samples had TTP of 24 to 48
hrs. Only 6% of the samples had TTP of more than 48 hours. Gram
negative pathogens (Average TTP- 12.5hours) have shorter TTP when
compared to Gram positive pathogens (Average TTP- 15.4 hours).With the
use of modern automated blood culture systems, TTP can be used as a
tool to guide the antimicrobial therapy and early de-escalation of the
empirical antibiotics thereby reducing the emergence of antimicrobial
resistance.

AB  - OBJECTIVES

Many physicians rely on differential time to positivity (DTP) when
diagnosing catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI). We
evaluated whether DTP from routine blood cultures can predict
catheter-related Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infection.

METHODS AND PATIENTS

From 2006 to 2011 adult patients with monomicrobial S. aureus
bloodstream infection and matched pairs of central and peripheral
blood cultures were prospectively followed. CRBSI was defined by the
absence of other infective foci and recovery of S. aureus from the
catheter tip or catheter exit-site, or local signs of infection at the
catheter exit site. A DTP of more than two hours (cut-off) was used to
define test positivity.

RESULTS

CRBSI was present in 30 (34%, prevalence) of 87 patients. In 24 (28%)
patients a DTP of more than two hours was measured: eleven patients
had CRBSI, ten deep-seated infections, and in three patients an
infective focus was not identified. DTP showed a positive predictive
value of 0.46 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.28 to 0.65], and a
negative predictive value of 0.70 [95% CI 0.58 to 0.80].

CONCLUSION

The low test performance suggests that DTP is not useful in diagnosing
CRBSI in routinely obtained blood cultures. Therefore, physicians
should not solely rely on DTP and rather promote catheter removal and
culture.

AB  - Abstract Background Endocarditis occurs in approximately 10%–15% of
patients with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB). Short time to
positivity (TTP) in blood culture flasks has been linked to
endocarditis in smaller studies. This study evaluated the association
between TTP and endocarditis in SAB in a large cohort. Methods Adult
patients with ≥1 S. aureus positive blood culture treated at a
tertiary-level, 500-bed hospital in Stockholm, Sweden between
2011–2021 were retrospectively identified. The primary outcome was the
presence of infective endocarditis. Results A total of 1703 episodes
of SAB (23/1703 methicillin-resistant) in 1610 patients were included.
Median age was 75 (interquartile range [IQR], 63–84) years and median
Charlson comorbidity index score was 2 (IQR, 1–3). Echocardiography
was performed in 1102/1703 (65%). Thirty-day mortality was 406/1703
(24%) and endocarditis was found in 154/1703 (9%). Median TTP was
shorter in patients with endocarditis (9 [IQR, 7–12] hours) compared
to patients without endocarditis (13 [interquartile range, 10–18]
hours; P < .001). The risk of endocarditis decreased with 11% per hour
(odds ratio [OR], 0.89 [95% confidence interval {CI}, .54–.92]; P <
.001) in a univariate analysis using TTP as a continuous variable. In
multivariate analysis, TTP <13 hours (the median) was independently
associated with endocarditis (OR, 3.59 [95% CI, 2.35–5.3]; P < .001).
The negative predictive value of TTP >13 hours for endocarditis was
96% (95% CI, 95%–97%). Conclusions Short TTP was associated with
endocarditis. The negative predictive value of >95% suggests that TTP
>13 hours can be used to risk-stratify patients with SAB.

AB  - Abstract Time to blood culture positivity (TTP) is an indirect measure
of bacterial concentration in blood. A short TTP has been linked to
the presence of infective endocarditis (IE) and to poor prognosis in
Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. We analyze factors influencing TTP
in bacteremia with Enterococcus faecalis . This retrospective
observational study of medical records included adults diagnosed with
monomicrobial E . faecalis bacteremia between 2015 and 2018 in the
Skåne region (Sweden). For each episode, the shortest TTP was
recorded. Median TTP was compared between patients grouped based on
age, sex, comorbidity, site of acquisition, and focus of infection.
Using a dichotomized TTP (shorter or longer than 12 h), a
multivariable logistic regression for factors associated to TTP was
performed. The association between TTP and IE or mortality was
evaluated. Three hundred sixty-seven episodes with monomicrobial E .
faecalis bacteremia with the corresponding TTP were identified. Median
TTP for the entire cohort was 11.6 (IQR 9.9–14.1) h and a
significantly shorter TTP was noted for episodes which represented IE
( n = 55, 9.4 (IQR 6.4–10.6) h). Only IE remained associated with a
short TTP (≤ 12 h) in binary logistic regression analysis. Factors
associated with IE were investigated and TTP was associated with IE
also when adjusted for age, gender, comorbidity, and nosocomial
acquisition. There was no association between TTP and mortality. A low
TTP is associated with IE in E . faecalis bacteremia and could be used
as a help in determining the need for echocardiography in patients
with this condition.

AB  - Gram stains of positive blood cultures are the most important factor
influencing appropriate therapy. The sooner appropriate therapy is
initiated, the better. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that the
sooner Gram stains are performed, the better. To determine the value
of timely Gram stains and whether improvement in Gram stain turnaround
time (TAT) is feasible, we compared data for matched pairs of patients
with cultures processed promptly (<1 hour TAT) with data for patients
with cultures not processed promptly (> or =1 hour TAT) and then
monitored TAT by control charting.In 99 matched pairs, average
difference in time to detection of positive blood cultures within a
pair of patients was less than 0.1 hour. For the less than 1 hour TAT
group, the average TAT and crude mortality were 0.1 hour and 10.1%,
respectively; for the 1 hour or longer TAT group, they were 3.3 hours
and 19.2%, respectively (P < .0001 and P = .0389, respectively). After
multifaceted efforts, we achieved significant improvement in the TAT
for Gram stains.

AB  - The long-term outcome of compliance with standard treatment
recommendations for Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia was assessed.
Cases of S. aureus bacteremia at our institution over a 2-y period
were reviewed and follow-up performed by review of subsequent
admissions or contact with primary care physicians. We encountered 226
cases (age 64.7±15.8 y) and most (171/226, 75.7%) had no removable
source. In-hospital mortality rate was 32.7% (74/226). Follow-up of
104/152 (68.4%) survivors (for 386.7±449.8 d) revealed 23.1% (24/104)
relapses: recurrent bacteremia (n=19), distant site (n=3) and local
recurrence (n=2). Most relapses (21/24; 87.5%) occurred within 90 d of
therapy. Relapse rate was higher with vancomycin treatment (20/48 vs.
4/56; p<0.001), bacteremia for ≥3 d (9/20 vs. 15/84; p=0.001), and
failure to remove the source (6/7 vs. 6/22; p=0.006). Vancomycin
effect was independent of oxacillin susceptibility. Treatment for less
than the standard 2-week duration among 19 patients with short
duration of bacteremia (<3 d) did not increase relapse rate (1/19;
5.3%). Duration of bacteremia, vancomycin therapy and failure to
remove the source were predictors of relapse. Prospective studies are
needed to determine if S. aureus bacteremias of short duration can be
treated for 2 weeks or less, and define the optimal duration for
prolonged bacteremia when vancomycin is used.

AB  - Early administration of appropriate antimicrobials has been correlated
with a better prognosis in patients with bacteremia, but the optimum
timing of early antibiotic administration as one of the resuscitation
strategies for severe bacterial infections remains unclear.In a
retrospective cohort study, adults with community-onset bacteremia at
the emergency department (ED) were analyzed. Effects of different
cutoffs of time to appropriate antibiotic (TtAa) administration after
arrival at the ED on 28-day mortality were examined, after adjustment
for independent predictors of mortality identified by multivariate
regression analysis.Among 2349 patients, the mean (interquartile
range) TtAa was 2.0 (<1 to 12) hours. All selected cutoffs of TtAa,
ranging from 1 to 96 hours, were significantly associated with 28-day
mortality (adjusted odds ratio (AOR), 0.54-0.65, all P < 0.001), after
adjustment of the following prognostic factors: fatal comorbidities
(McCabe classification), critical illness (Pitt bacteremia score (PBS)
≥4) on arrival at the ED, polymicrobial bacteremia, extended-spectrum
beta-lactamase-producer bacteremia, underlying malignancies or liver
cirrhosis, and bacteremia caused by pneumonia or urinary tract
infections. The adverse impact of TtAa on 28-day mortality was most
evident at the cutoff of 48 hours, as the lowest AOR was identified
(0.54, P < 0.001). In subgroup analyses, the most evident TtAa cutoff
(i.e., the lowest AOR) remained at 48 hours in mildly ill (PBS = 0;
AOR 0.47; P = 0.04) and moderately ill (PBS = 1-3; AOR 0.55; P = 0.02)
patients, but shifted to 1 hour in critically ill patients (PBS ≥4;
AOR 0.56; P < 0.001).The time from triage to administration of
appropriate antimicrobials is one of the primary determinants of
mortality. The optimum timing of appropriate antimicrobial
administration is the first 48 hours after non-critically ill patients
arrive at the ED. As bacteremia severity increases, effective
antimicrobial therapy should be empirically prescribed within 1 hour
after critically ill patients arrive at the ED.

AB  - Time to Positivity (TTP) measures the interval from incubation to
bacterial growth detection in blood cultures. Although shorter TTP is
associated with higher mortality, factors associated with TTP remain
uncertain. A retrospective cohort study was conducted among Queensland
residents with positive blood cultures between 2000–2019. Incident
bloodstream infections (BSIs) were identified using Pathology
Queensland data, with demographic, clinical, and outcome data linked
to state-wide databases. The study analysed 84,341 patients with
monomicrobial BSI with a median patient age of 65.6 years (IQR
45.4–78.1), and most infections being community-associated (77.0%).
Age showed a non-linear relationship with TTP, and male sex was linked
with slightly higher TTP (Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) 1.01; 95%
Confidence Intervals (CI) 1.00–1.02; p = 0.011), reflecting a small
but measurable association. Liver disease and malignancy were
associated with lower TTP (IRR 0.93; 95% CI 0.91–0.95; p < 0.0001 and
IRR 0.95; 95% CI 0.94–0.97; p < 0.0001 respectively), whilst diabetes
showed no significant difference (IRR 1.01; 95% CI 1.00–1.02;
p = 0.0840). Hospital onset infections exhibited longer TTPs (IRR
1.09; 95% CI 1.08–1.10; p < 0.0001). There are several host
characteristics associated with TTP that may in part explain the
complex relationship between this variable and mortality. Beyond
microbiological factors such as isolate type, TTP is also influenced
by clinical variables including patient demographics and infection
characteristics highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker.
Further evaluation is needed to clarify its role in predicting patient
outcomes and guiding tailored treatment strategies.

AB  - Time-to-positivity is useful in the diagnosis of catheter-related
bacteraemia and as a predictor of an endovascular source in patients
with Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia. However, this parameter has
been evaluated for only a limited number of microorganisms. In the
present study, time-to-positivity was recorded for 1872 episodes of
significant monomicrobial bacteraemia diagnosed at a teaching hospital
during a 2-year period, and the associated microbial and clinical
variables were investigated. According to multivariate analysis,
Streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-haemolytic streptococci, Escherichia
coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Citrobacter and Aeromonas were
characterised by fast growth, with an endovascular source, shock,
liver cirrhosis and neutropenia also predicting a short
time-to-positivity. For patients not receiving appropriate
antibiotics, detection of Gram-positive cocci in clusters within 14 h
was predictive of Staph. aureus; a time-to-positivity of >21 h ruled
out the possibility that a Gram-positive organism in chains was a
beta-haemolytic streptococcus or Strep. pneumoniae, and a
time-to-positivity of < or =12 h meant that it was very unlikely that
a Gram-negative bacillus was a non-fermenter. A time-to-positivity of
< or =8 h was predictive of a non-urinary tract source in patients
with E. coli bacteraemia, and detection of growth within 13 h
predicted an endovascular source in those with Staph. aureus
bacteraemia. In conclusion, time-to-positivity depended on the
microorganism, original source and clinical variables involved.
Although this measurement may provide some early clues concerning the
microorganisms involved and the source of bacteraemia, its clinical
impact remains to be defined.

AB  - The potential performance of time-to-positivity (TTP) in predicting
the prognosis of individuals experiencing Bloodstream infections
(BSIs) has achieved little consensus. The retrospective cohort of 1015
treatment-naive adults with community-onset monomicrobial BSIs aimed
to assess the performance of TTP and modified TTP (mTTP, TTP plus
transportation time) in predicting 30-day mortality after adjusting
for prognostic confounders, particularly the time-to-appropriate
antibiotic (TtAa). Through Spearman's correlation, a significant
linear-by-linear association (ρ = -0.943, P = 0.005) was exhibited
between mTTP and 30-day mortality rates, but no significant
association (ρ = -0.423, P = 0.26) was disclosed between TTP and
30-day mortality rates in the overall patient population. In the
logistic regression model, each additional hour of mTTP or TTP was
associated with an average decrease of 5 % (adjusted odds ratio [AOR],
0.95; P = 0.001) or 3 % (AOR, 0.97; P = 0.03) in the 30-day mortality
rates, respectively, after adjusting for independent predictors of
30-day mortality. In conclusion, for adults with community-onset
monomicrobial BSIs, mTTP revealed a favorable performance over TTP
alone in predicting short-term mortality.

AB  - Bloodstream infections (BSI) are frequent and serious complications in
intensive care units (ICU) and are associated with high morbidity and
mortality rates, increased hospital stay and healthcare-related
costs.(1-3) In general, blood culture is the most important laboratory
resource for the diagnosis and investigation of BSI; in addition,
blood cultures also provide information regarding time to positivity
(TTP), which can be used to predict prognosis, allow the evaluation of
the efficacy of current antimicrobial therapies and are important to
evaluate bacterial load and differentiate real infections from
contaminants.(4,5) However, the use of TTP to evaluate blood culture
results is still questioned. This retrospective study aimed to analyze
the importance of TTP of microorganisms related to BSI in patients
admitted to the ICU of a tertiary hospital in Curitiba from June 2013
to May 2018. The study was approved by the ethics committee of
research involving humans (reference number 067486/2016; approval
letter dated November 2016). Blood cultures were obtained from
patients with suspected BSI and were incubated on a BD BACTECTM FX®
automated system. Positive blood culture isolates were identified
using VITEK 2® automated system (bioMérieux, Durham, North Carolina)
and standardized methodologies.(6) Repeated monomicrobial episodes of
bacteremia with the same pathogen isolated from the same patient
within a month accounted for one blood culture. Polymicrobial cultures
were excluded from the study. Time to positivity was recorded for each
positive sample. When more than one culture bottle was positive, the
first TTP was recorded. Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) were
classified according to the number of positive bottles: one (CNS +)
was considered a contaminant, and two or more (CNS ++) were considered
true BSIs. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version
20.0, and a p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
In the 5-year study period, 5,425 blood cultures were collected from
ICU; 107 were polymicrobial and 968 were positive for one
microorganism, resulting in a positivity rate of 19%. Among the
analyzed cultures, in 194 were identified contaminant CNS (contaminant
rate 3.5%), resulting in 774 true positive blood cultures.
Gram-positive pathogens were the most frequently isolated pathogens in
the ICU-BSI samples (n = 502, 64.8%), followed by gram-negative
pathogens Suellen Gavronski1 , Keite da Silva Nogueira1

AB  - Abstract The association between time to positivity (TTP) of blood
culture and the clinical prognosis of patients with Klebsiella
pneumoniae bloodstream infection (BSI) remains unclear. A
retrospective study of 148 inpatients with BSI caused by K. pneumoniae
was performed at Shanghai Tongji Hospital, China, from October
2016–2020. The total in-hospital fatality rate was 32%. The median TTP
was 11.0 (7.7–16.1) h and the optimal cutoff for prediction of
in-hospital mortality was 9.4 h according to the ROC curve. Early TTP
(<9.4 h) was a risk factor for in-hospital mortality by univariate
analysis (OR = 2.5, 95% CI 1.2–5.0, P = 0.01), but not by multivariate
analysis (OR = 2.7, 95% CI 1.0–7.4, P = 0.06). Old age, serum
creatinine, white blood cells, and C-reactive protein values were risk
factors for in-hospital mortality by multivariate analysis. Early TTP
was not a risk factor for septic shock (OR = 1.8, 95% CI 0.6–5.1, P =
0.27) or ICU admission (OR = 1.0, 95% CI 1.0–1.0, P = 0.32). In
conclusion, the in-hospital fatality rate of patients with K.
pneumoniae BSI was relatively high and associated with an early TTP of
blood cultures. However, no increased risk of mortality, septic shock
or ICU admission was evident in early TTP patients.

AB  - ABSTRACT Current automated continuous-monitoring blood culture systems
afford more rapid detection of bacteremia and fungemia than is
possible with non-instrument-based manual methods. Use of these
systems has not been studied objectively with respect to impact on
patient outcomes, including hospital charges and length of
hospitalization. We conducted a prospective, two-center study in which
the time from the obtainment of the initial positive blood culture
until the Gram stain was called was evaluated for 917 cases of
bloodstream infection. Factors showing univariate associations with a
shorter time to notification included higher body temperature and
respiratory rate and higher percentage of immature neutrophils.
Multiple linear regression models determined that the primary
predictors of both increased microbiology laboratory and total
hospital charges for patients with bloodstream infection were
nonmicrobiologic and included length of stay and host factors such as
the admitting service and underlying illness score. Significant
microbiologic predictors of increased charges included the number of
blood cultures obtained, nosocomial acquisition, and polymicrobial
bloodstream infections. Accelerated failure time regression analysis
demonstrated that microbiologic factors, including time until
notification, organism group, and nosocomial acquisition, were
independently associated with length of hospitalization after
bacteremia, as were the factors of admitting service, gender, and age.
Our data suggest that an increased time to notification of bloodstream
infection is independently associated with increased length of stay.
We conclude that the time to notification is an obvious target for
efforts to shorten length of stay. The newest generation of automated
continuous-monitoring blood culture systems, which shorten the time
required to obtain a positive result, should impact length of
hospitalization.

AB  - BACKGROUND

The clinical usefulness of follow-up blood cultures (FUBCs) in
gram-negative bloodstream infections (GN-BSIs) represents a debated
issue.

OBJECTIVE

To assess the impact on the clinical outcome of FUBCs in patients with
GN-BSI and to predict risk factors for persistent bacteraemia.

DATA SOURCES

PubMed-MEDLINE, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library Database were
independently searched until 24 June, 2022.

STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA

Randomized controlled trials, prospective, or retrospective
observational studies, including patients affected by GN-BSIs. Primary
endpoints were in-hospital mortality rate, and persistent blood stream
infections were defined as FUBC-positive for the same pathogen
isolated from index blood cultures (BCs).

PARTICIPANTS

Hospitalized patients with documented GN-BSIs.

INTERVENTION

Performance of FUBCs (defined as subsequent BCs collected at least
24 hours after index BCs).

ASSESSMENT OF RISK OF BIAS

Quality of included studies was independently assessed according to
the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized
Studies of Interventions.

METHODS OF DATA SYNTHESIS

Meta-analysis was performed by pooling odds ratio (OR) retrieved from
studies providing adjustment for confounders using random-effect model
with the inverse variance method. Risk factors for persistent blood
stream infections were also assessed.

RESULTS

A total of 3747 articles were screened, and 11 observational studies
(6 assessing impact on outcome (N = 4631), and 5 investigating risk
factors for persistent GN-BSI (N = 2566)), conducted between 2002 and
2020 were included. The execution of FUBCs was associated with a
significantly lower risk of mortality (OR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.49-0.70; I

CONCLUSIONS

The execution of FUBCs is associated with a significantly low risk of
mortality in patients with GN-BSIs. Our analysis could be useful to
stratify patients at a high risk of persistent bacteraemia to optimize
the use of FUBCs.

AB  - Bloodstream infections (BSIs) by Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase
(KPC)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp) are associated with high
mortality. The aim of this study is to assess the relationship between
time to administration of appropriate antibiotic therapy and the
outcome of patients with BSI due to KPC-Kp hospitalized in intensive
care unit (ICU).An observational study was conducted in the ICUs of
two academic centers in Italy. Patients with KPC-Kp bacteremia
hospitalized between January 2015 to December 2018 were included. The
primary outcome was the relationship between time from blood cultures
(BC) collection to appropriate antibiotic therapy and 30-day
mortality. The secondary outcome was to evaluate the association of
different treatment regimens with 30-day mortality and a composite
endpoint (30-day mortality or nephrotoxicity). A Cox regression
analysis to identify factors independently associated with 30-day
mortality was performed. Hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval
(CI) were calculated.A total of 102 patients with KPC-Kp BSI were
included. The most common sources of infection were intra-abdominal
(23.5%), urinary tract (20.6%), and skin and skin structure (17.6%).
The 30-day mortality was 45%. Median time to appropriate antibiotic
therapy was shorter in patients who survived (8.5 h [IQR 1-36]) versus
those who died (48 h [IQR 5-108], p = 0.014). A propensity score
matching showed that receipt of an in vitro active therapy within 24 h
from BC collection was associated with lower 30-day mortality (HR =
0.36, 95% CI: 0.188-0.690, p = 0.0021). At Cox regression analysis,
factors associated with 30-day mortality were primary bacteremia (HR
2.662 [95% CI 1.118-6.336], p = 0.027), cardiovascular disease (HR
2.196 [95% CI 1.082-4.457], p = 0.029), time (24-h increments) from BC
collection to appropriate therapy (HR 1.382 [95% CI 1.132-1.687], p =
0.001), SOFA score (HR 1.122 [95% CI 1.036-1.216], p = 0.005), and age
(HR 1.030 [95% CI 1.006-1.054], p = 0.012).
Ceftazidime-avibactam-containing regimens were associated with reduced
risk of composite endpoint (30-day mortality OR nephrotoxicity) (HR
0.231 [95% CI 0.071-0.745], p = 0.014) compared to colistin-containing
regimens.Time to appropriate antibiotic therapy is an independent
predictor of 30-day mortality in patients with KPC-Kp BSI. Appropriate
antibiotic therapy should begin within 24 h from the collection of BC.

AB  - Abstract Background Persistent Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia is
associated with metastatic infection and adverse outcomes, whereas
gram-negative bacteremia is normally transient and shorter course
therapy is increasingly advocated for affected patients. Whether the
prolonged detection of pathogen DNA in blood by culture-independent
systems could have prognostic value and guide management decisions is
unknown. Methods We performed a multicenter, prospective,
observational study on 102 patients with bloodstream infection (BSI)
to compare time to bloodstream clearance according to T2 magnetic
resonance and blood cultures over a 4-day follow-up. We also explored
the association between duration of detectable pathogens according to
T2 magnetic resonance (magnetic resonance–DNAemia [MR-DNAemia]) and
clinical outcomes. Results Time to bloodstream clearance according to
T2 magnetic resonance was significantly longer than blood culture
clearance (HR, .54; 95% CI, .39–.75) and did not differ according to
the causative pathogen (P = .5). Each additional day of MR-DNAemia
increased the odds of persistent infection (defined as metastatic
infection or delayed source control) both in the overall population
(OR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.45–2.70) and in S. aureus (OR, 1.92; 95% CI,
1.12–3.29) and gram-negative bacteremia (OR, 2.21; 95% CI, 1.35–3.60).
MR-DNAemia duration was also associated with no improvement in
Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score at day 7 from infection
onset (OR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.21–2.56). Conclusions T2 magnetic resonance
may help diagnose BSI in patients on antimicrobials with negative
blood cultures as well as to identify patients with metastatic
infection, source control failure, or adverse short-term outcome.
Future studies may inform its usefulness within the setting of
antimicrobial stewardship programs.

by central laboratory personnel from July 2010 to March 2011. TTP in
each patient was determined using an automated blood culture
instrument. Each patient was included only once at the time of
detection of the first bloodstream infection. During the study period,
a total of 329 sets of blood cultures positive for Candida were
isolated from 176 patients. The mean TTP for all isolates causing
candidaemia was 25.9±24.9 h. The TTP for C. glabrata was significantly
longer than the TTP of the other species. In contrast, the TTP of C.
tropicalis was significantly shorter than that of the other three
species. The diagnostic sensitivity of TTP for C. glabrata isolates in
patients with candidaemia was 93.9% (95% CI 0.798-0.993), the
specificity was 66.4% (95% CI 0.581-0.741), the positive predictive
value was 39.2% (95% CI 0.286-0.509), and the negative predictive
value was 97.9% (95% CI 0.92-0.996) with a TTP cut-off value of >27.7
h. In conclusion, the different TTP values of different Candida
species causing bloodstream infection may be helpful in
differentiating C. glabrata from other Candida species.

AB  - This study performed a retrospective analysis on the relationship
between blood culture time-to-positivity (TP) and type of isolated
microorganism, antibiotic administration, and immunological status of
the patients. We analyzed the data related to 1,218 positive blood
cultures. When compared to Gram positive bacteraemia, the percentage
of Gram negative growth was higher and the mean TP significantly
shorter (p < 0.0001). In patients receiving antibiotics, median and
mean TPs of blood culture were different for Gram positive bacteraemia
(log-rank p = 0.0022, Wilcoxon p < 0.0001) but not for Gram negative
(log-rank p = 0.4011, Wilcoxon p = 0.1585). No statistically
significant effect on TP was found for sampling site, interaction
between sampling site and antibiotic administration, and immunological
status of the patient. In conclusion, TP is independent of antibiotic
therapy in cases of Gram negative bacteraemia, while for Gram positive
bacteraemia a prolongation of TP occurs.

AB  - PURPOSE

Candidemia is an important issue of nosocomial bloodstream infections,
and is associated with a high mortality rate. However, little
information is available before final species identification, which
takes days after the episode of candidemia. This study tried to
determine whether time to positivity (TTP) for yeast helps in
predicting the species of candidemia.

METHODS

A retrospective cohort study was conducted in Taiwan, which included
434 episodes of nonduplicated candidemia during the period between
2006 and 2009. The demographic features, clinical characteristics, TTP
for yeast, and acute illness scores were included for analysis.

RESULTS

The mean age of patients with candidemia was 70.4 ± 15.2 years, and
the 30-day crude mortality rate was 48.2%. Forty-five percent of
patients suffered from shock status with a mean Acute Physiological
and Chronic Health Evaluation II score of 27.0 ± 8.7 and a mean
Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score of 9.7 ± 4.5, whereas 50%
were admitted to the intensive care units. Candida albicans was still
the most commonly identified pathogen (58.1%), followed by C.
tropicalis (14.7%), C. parapsilosis (13.1%), and C. glabrata (8.3%).
Results of multivariate logistic regression showed that TTP for yeast
within 48 hours would more favor C. tropicalis (p = 0.044), and less
favor C. glabrata (p = 0.025) and C. parapsilosis (p < 0.001).
Patients with parenteral nutrition usage were more frequently
associated with a TTP for yeast within 48 hours, whereas those with
previous exposure to an antifungal agent had a longer TTP for yeast.

CONCLUSION

The TTP for yeast might provide a hint of the responsible Candida
species before final identification among critical patients with
candidemia. The association between antifungal agents and TTP would
need more evidence for elucidation.

AB  - IntroductionBacteremia causes a high mortality rate. Detection of
bacteremia is needed as quickly as possible. The gold standard for
bacteremia is blood culture which takes between 24-48 hours.
Procalcitonin (PCT) is a marker of infection that is caused by
bacteria that can be detected quickly in 2-6 hours. Time to positivity
(TTP) blood culture is affected by the initial amount of bacteria and
the addition of procalcitonin stimulated by bacteria that causes
bacteremia where short TTP and high PCT show bad clinical conditions.
Materials and MethodsAnalitical cross sectional research on patients
with bacteremia. Fourty six bacteremia cases become the sample of
research. Time to Positivity is calculated with Bactec 9050 and
Procalcitonin is analyzed with mini VIDAS B.R.A.H.M.S. Examination is
conducted in Department of Clinical Pathology FK-USU/ Installation of
Clinical Pathology of RSUP H. Adam Malik, Medan, June – October 2016.
ResultsThere was significant correlation between Time to Positivity
blood culture and procalcitonin on bacteremia patients (p<0.05). There
was no significant correlation between Time to Positivity and
procalcitonin on bacteremia which was caused by gram-positive bacteria
or gram-negative bacteria (p>0.05). Procalcitonin was significantly
higher on bacteremia which was caused by gram-negative bacteria
compared to gram-positive bacteria (p<0.05). ConclusionThere was
significant correlation between Time to Positivity blood culture and
procalcitonin on bacteremia patients. Significantly higher levels of
procalcitonin in cases of bacteremia are more likely to be caused by
Gram-negative bacteria than Gram-positive bacteria

AB  - Importance: Previous investigations have found that time to positive
blood culture (TTP) is a prognostic factor for clinical outcomes. In
fact, what the emergency physician sees from the medical information
system is TAT (turnaround time) defined as time required to post a
bacterial culture report. We propose a definition of blood culture TAT
that more closely aligns with clinical considerations by measuring the
time from starting specimen culture to the release of an official
blood culture report.We were curious to know whether the duration of
TAT is as intricately linked to the prognosis of bacteremia as TTP.
Objectives: To examine the association between TAT and outcomes of
adult patients who present to the ED with community acquired
bacteremia. Design: Setting, and Participants: This retrospective
study utilized electronic medical records from Kaohsiung Veterans
General Hospital (KVGH), a 1000-bed tertiary medical center in Taiwan.
Patients were adults aged 18 years and older who presented to ED
(Emergency department) for initial diagnosis of community acquired
bacteremia from January 1, 2016 to March 31, 2021. Data analysis was
performed from December 2022 to January 2023.Main outcomes and
measures.The primary outcomes included mortality in the ED, all-cause
in-hospital mortality, length of hospital stay, and all-cause 30-day
mortality in relation to the individual first report of positive blood
culture TAT. Results: A total of 4011 eligible patients with
bacteremia were evaluated, of which 207 patients had a blood culture
TAT of ≤48 h. The overall 30-day all-cause mortality rate was 13%.
Contrary to expectation, no statistically significant differences were
observed in clinical prognosis between the TAT groups (≤48 versus >48
h). Subgroup analyses indicated that the length of TAT did not have a
significant effect on clinical prognosis in patients who underwent
lactate level assessment. Furthermore, no difference in clinical
outcome was noted between TAT groups (≤48 versus >48 h) in terms of
Gram-negative bacilli or Gram-positive cocci bacteremia. However, in
patients with delayed antibiotic treatment (>3 h), a shorter TAT was
significantly associated with a fatal outcome. Conclusion: In adults
with community-acquired bacteremia, this study did not observe a
significant association between blood culture TAT and clinical
prognosis, except in cases of delayed antibiotic treatment.

AB  - In the management of bacteremia, positive repeat blood cultures
(persistent bacteremia) are associated with increased mortality.
However, blood cultures are costly and it is likely unnecessary to
repeat them for many patients. We assessed predictors of persistent
bacteremia that should prompt repeat blood cultures.We conducted a
retrospective cohort study of bacteremias at an academic hospital from
April 2010 to June 2014. We examined variables associated with
patients undergoing repeat blood cultures, and with repeat cultures
being positive. A nested case control analysis was performed on a
subset of patients with repeat cultures.Among 1801 index bacteremias,
repeat cultures were drawn for 701 patients (38.9 %), and 118
persistent bacteremias (6.6 %) were detected. Endovascular source
(adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 7.66; 95 % confidence interval [CI],
2.30-25.48), epidural source (aOR, 26.99; 95 % CI, 1.91-391.08), and
Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (aOR, 4.49; 95 % CI, 1.88-10.73) were
independently associated with persistent bacteremia. Escherichia coli
(5.1 %, P = 0.006), viridans group (1.7 %, P = 0.035) and β-hemolytic
streptococci (0 %, P = 0.028) were associated with a lower likelihood
of persistent bacteremia. Patients with persistent bacteremia were
less likely to have achieved source control within 48 h of the index
event (29.7 % vs 52.5 %, P < .001), but after variable reduction,
source control was not retained in the final multivariable
model.Patients with S. aureus bacteremia or endovascular infection are
at risk of persistent bacteremia. Achieving source control within 48 h
of the index bacteremia may help clear the infection. Repeat cultures
after 48 h are low yield for most Gram-negative and streptococcal
bacteremias.

Antibiotic overuse drives antibiotic resistance. Gram-negative
bacteremia is a common infection that results in substantial
antibiotic use.

Objective

To compare the clinical effectiveness of C-reactive protein
(CRP)-guided, 7-day, and 14-day antibiotic durations 30, 60, and 90
days after treatment initiation.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Multicenter, noninferiority, point-of-care randomized clinical trial
including adults hospitalized with gram-negative bacteremia conducted
in 3 Swiss tertiary care hospitals between April 2017 and May 2019,
with follow-up until August 2019. Patients and physicians were blinded
between randomization and antibiotic discontinuation. Adults (aged ≥18
years) were eligible for randomization on day 5 (±1 d) of
microbiologically efficacious therapy for fermenting, gram-negative
bacteria in blood culture(s) if they were afebrile for 24 hours
without evidence for complicated infection (eg, abscess) or severe
immunosuppression.

Intervention

Randomization in a 1:1:1 ratio to an individualized CRP-guided
antibiotic treatment duration (discontinuation once CRP declined by
75% from peak; n = 170), fixed 7-day treatment duration (n = 169), or
fixed 14-day treatment duration (n = 165).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the clinical failure rate at day 30, defined
as the presence of at least 1 of the following, with a non-inferiority
margin of 10%: recurrent bacteremia, local suppurative complication,
distant complication (growth of the same organism causing the initial
bacteremia), restarting gram-negative-directed antibiotic therapy due
to clinical worsening suspected to be due to the initial organism, or
death due to any cause. Secondary outcomes included the clinical
failure rate on day 90 of follow-up.

Results

Among 504 patients randomized (median [interquartile range] age, 79
[68-86] years; 306 of 503 [61%] were women), 493 (98%) completed
30-day follow-up and 448 (89%) completed 90-day follow-up. Median
antibiotic duration in the CRP group was 7 (interquartile range, 6-10;
range, 5-28) days; 34 of the 164 patients (21%) who completed the
30-day follow-up had protocol violations related to treatment
assignment. The primary outcome occurred in 4 of 164 (2.4%) patients
in the CRP group, 11 of 166 (6.6%) in the 7-day group, and 9 of 163
(5.5%) in the 14-day group (difference in CRP vs 14-day group, -3.1%
[1-sided 97.5% CI, -∞ to 1.1]; P < .001; difference in 7-day vs 14-day
group, 1.1% [1-sided 97.5% CI, -∞ to 6.3]; P < .001). By day 90,
clinical failure occurred in 10 of 143 patients (7.0%) in the CRP
group, 16 of 151 (10.6%) in the 7-day group, and 16 of 153 (10.5%) in
the 14-day group.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among adults with uncomplicated gram-negative bacteremia, 30-day rates
of clinical failure for CRP-guided antibiotic treatment duration and
fixed 7-day treatment were noninferior to fixed 14-day treatment.
However, interpretation is limited by the large noninferiority margin
compared with the low observed event rate, as well as low adherence
and wide range of treatment durations in the CRP-guided group.

AB  - BACKGROUND

Patients with severe bacterial infections often experience delay in
receiving appropriate treatment. Consolidated evidence of the impact
of delayed appropriate treatment is needed to guide treatment and
improve outcomes.

RESEARCH QUESTION

What is the impact of delayed appropriate antibacterial therapy on
clinical outcomes in patients with severe bacterial infections?

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS

Literature searches of MEDLINE and Embase, conducted on July 24, 2018,
identified studies published after 2007 reporting the impact of
delayed appropriate therapy on clinical outcomes for hospitalized
adult patients with bacterial infections. Where appropriate, results
were pooled and analyzed with delayed therapy modeled three ways:
delay vs no delay in receiving appropriate therapy; duration of delay;
and inappropriate vs appropriate initial therapy. This article reports
meta-analyses on the effect of delay and duration of delay.

RESULTS

The eligibility criteria were met by 145 studies, of which 37
contributed data to analyses of effect of delay. Mortality was
significantly lower in patients receiving appropriate therapy without
delay compared with those experiencing delay (OR, 0.57; 95% CI,
0.45-0.72). Mortality was also lower in the no-delay group compared
with the delay group in subgroups of studies reporting mortality at 20
to 30 days, during ICU stay, or in patients with bacteremia (OR, 0.57
[95% CI, 0.43-0.76]; OR, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.27-0.80]; and OR, 0.54
[95% CI, 0.40-0.75], respectively). No difference was found in time to
appropriate therapy between those who died and those who survived (P =
.09), but heterogeneity between studies was high.

INTERPRETATION

Avoiding delayed appropriate therapy is essential to reduce mortality
in patients with severe bacterial infections.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Early diagnosis of candidemia is of vital
importance in reducing mortality and morbidity. The main objective of
the study was to determine the TTP (Time to Positivity) of different
species of Candida causing bloodstream infection and to see whether
TTP can help differentiate Candida glabrata which is frequently
fluconazole resistant from Fluconazole sensitive Candida. Materials
and Methods: TTP (Time to positivity) and AAT (Appropriate Antifungal
therapy) were noted for Blood cultures becoming positive for Candida.
Presence of Risk factors for candidemia like prolonged ICU stay,
neutropenia, Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN), use of steroids , broad
spectrum antibiotics, use of Central Venous Catheter, Foleys catheter
were also analyzed. Results: The most frequent isolates were Candida
parapsilosis, Candida tropicalis and Candida albicans. The median TTP
for all Candida isolates in our study was 34 hours. The diagnostic
sensitivity of TTP for detecting C. glabrata and C. tropicalis in
patients with candidemia was 88% and 85% respectively. TTP showed that
there was no difference in survival between TTP <24 hrs. and > 24hrs.
Initiation of antifungal therapy <24 hours and > 24hrs after onset of
candidemia had no association with survival. Conclusion: Longer TTP
maybe predictive of C. glabrata while shorter TTP may be predictive of
C. tropicalis. In our study we found that fluconazole resistant
Candida causing blood stream infection is quite unlikely if the TTP of
the isolate is <48hrs.

AB  - The aim of this study was to systematically evaluate the predictive
value of time to positivity (TTP) in candidemia. All first episodes of
candidemic patients admitted to our hospital between January 2008 and
July 2012 were recorded retrospectively. We analyzed the relationship
between TTP, identification of Candida species, antifungal agent
susceptibility, and patients' clinical characteristics (30-day
mortality, underlying diseases, and associated risk factors). TTP of
simulated blood culture with equal inoculum amounts of different
Candida species was determined. We included 87 patients during the
study period, with a mean TTP of 43.47 ± 19.51 h. TTP of C. glabrata
was significantly longer (p < 0.001) and TTP of C. tropicalis was
significantly shorter (p < 0.001) than that of other Candida species.
Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that TTP
can predict C. glabrata (with the cut-off value of >45.17 h) and C.
tropicalis (with the cut-off value of ≤33.17 h) in candidemia with
good sensitivity and specificity. No statistically significant
relationship was found between TTP, antifungal agent susceptibility,
and patients' clinical characteristics (p > 0.05). TTP was not a risk
factor associated with mortality (p > 0.05). The TTP result in
simulated blood culture was in accordance with that of the included
patients. TTP has been demonstrated to be helpful to differentiate C.
glabrata and C. tropicalis from other Candida species in candidemia,
and it is not associated with antifungal agent susceptibility and
patients' clinical characteristics. TTP cannot predict pathogen
concentration in the blood of candidemic patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND

Gram-negative bacteria are an important cause of severe sepsis. Recent
studies have demonstrated reduced susceptibility of Gram-negative
bacteria to currently available antimicrobial agents.

METHODS

We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients with severe
sepsis who were bacteremic with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter
species, or Enterobacteriaceae from 2002 to 2007. Patients were
identified by the hospital informatics database and pertinent clinical
data (demographics, baseline severity of illness, source of
bacteremia, and therapy) were retrieved from electronic medical
records. All patients were treated with antimicrobial agents within 12
hours of having blood cultures drawn that were subsequently positive
for bacterial pathogens. The primary outcome was hospital mortality.

RESULTS

A total of 535 patients with severe sepsis and Gram-negative
bacteremia were identified. Hospital mortality was 43.6%, and 82
(15.3%) patients were treated with an antimicrobial regimen to which
the causative pathogen was resistant. Patients infected with a
resistant pathogen had significantly greater risk of hospital
mortality (63.4% vs 40.0%; P < 0.001). In a multivariate analysis,
infection with a pathogen that was resistant to the empiric antibiotic
regimen, increasing APACHE II scores, infection with Pseudomonas
aeruginosa, healthcare-associated hospital-onset infection, mechanical
ventilation, and use of vasopressors were independently associated
with hospital mortality.

CONCLUSIONS

In severe sepsis attributed to Gram-negative bacteremia, initial
treatment with an antibiotic regimen to which the causative pathogen
is resistant was associated with increased hospital mortality. This
finding suggests that rapid determination of bacterial susceptibility
could influence treatment choices in patients with severe sepsis
potentially improving their clinical outcomes.

AB  - ABSTRACT Differentiating true coagulase-negative staphylococcal
infection from contamination has an important impact on therapeutic
implications. Time to positivity reflects bacterial density and may
help in the interpretation of blood cultures. We retrospectively
reviewed the records of 272 patients from June 2005 to January 2008
for clinical characteristics, microbiological data, and therapeutic
outcome. Four groups were identified. The first three groups, as
follows, included patients with one positive quantitative blood
culture: the low-colony-count group (<10 CFU/ml), the
moderate-colony-count group (30 to 100 CFU/ml), and the
high-colony-count group (>100 CFU/ml). The control group included
patients with two positive quantitative blood cultures and definite
coagulase-negative staphylococcal bloodstream infection. The
high-colony-count group had shorter time to positivity (≤16 h) than
did the low-colony-count group (P < 0.0001). The low-colony-count
group had a significantly longer time to positivity, >20 h (P =
0.001), than did the moderate-colony-count group. Even though
antibiotics were not provided in 71% of cases and central venous
catheter was retained in 83%, the low-colony-count group had a
favorable outcome, suggesting that <10 CFU/ml represents
contamination. The high-colony-count group, similar to the positive
control group, required antibiotics in 81% of cases and central venous
catheter removal in 51% (P = 0.001). A time to positivity of ≤16 h
reflects high-grade bacteremia with CFU of >100. Similar to the
positive control group, these patients required an active therapeutic
approach. A time to positivity of >20 h indicates possible
contamination with a CFU of <10, and active therapy may not be
required.

AB  - OBJECTIVE

To develop and validate a model predicting whether a positive blood
culture represents a true positive or a contaminant in hospitalized
patients, using only information available when the initial culture
result becomes available.

DESIGN

Prospective cohort study with derivation and validation sets.

SETTING

Urban tertiary care hospital.

PATIENTS

Clinical data were collected within 24 hours of the initial culture
from a random sample of inpatients who had blood cultures performed,
and data from the episodes in which growth was reported were included.
There were 219 episodes in the derivation set and 129 episodes in the
validation set.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE

True bacteremia. Reviewers blinded to potential clinical predictors
and initial laboratory results classified 115 (53%) of the episodes in
the derivation set and 57 (44%) of the episodes in the validation set
as true positives.

RESULTS

Independent multivariate predictors of bacteremia were organism type,
days until the blood culture became positive, multiple positive
cultures, and clinical risk score. These factors were used to develop
a model stratifying patients into four risk groups. In the derivation
set's lowest-risk group, 92% (65/71) of positives represented
contaminants, and in the highest-risk group, 97% (86/89) of positives
represented true positives. In the validation set, the
misclassification rates were 14% (8/59) in the low-risk group, and 11%
(5/44) in the high-risk group. These two groups together comprised 76%
of all episodes.

CONCLUSION

This model can help clinicians quantify the likelihood that a given
positive blood culture represents a true positive when the laboratory
first calls, which may be helpful in subsequent decision making.

AB  - BACKGROUND

With increasing prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE),
appropriate antibiotic therapy for enterococcal bloodstream infections
(EBSI) can be delayed. Data regarding the impact of delayed therapy on
EBSI outcomes are conflicting, and the time delay most strongly
associated with poor outcomes has not been defined.

METHODS

This was a single-center, retrospective cohort study of adult,
nonneutropenic patients with hospital-onset EBSI from 2010 to 2014.
Classification and regression tree (CART) analysis was used to
determine the delay in appropriate therapy most predictive of 30-day
mortality. Appropriate therapy was defined as antibiotic therapy to
which the enterococci and copathogen, where applicable, were
susceptible. Outcomes and clinical characteristics were compared
between patients receiving early or delayed therapy, defined by CART
timepoint. Poisson regression was employed to determine the
independent association of delayed therapy on 30-day mortality and
predictors of delayed therapy.

RESULTS

Overall, 190 patients were included. A breakpoint in time to
appropriate therapy was identified at 48.1 hours, where 30-day
mortality was substantially increased (14.6% vs 45.3%; P < .001).
Patients receiving appropriate therapy after 48.1 hours also
experienced higher in-hospital mortality and longer EBSI duration.
After adjustment for severity of illness and comorbidity, delayed
therapy ≥48.1 hours was associated with a 3-fold increase in 30-day
mortality (risk ratio, 3.16 [95% confidence interval, 1.96-5.09]).
Vancomycin resistance was the only independent predictor of delayed
therapy.

CONCLUSIONS

In patients with hospital-onset EBSI, receipt of appropriate therapy
within the first 48 hours was associated with reduced mortality,
underscoring the potential role of rapid diagnostic testing for early
identification of VRE.

AB  - The study presented here investigated the impact of initial antibiotic
choice (beta-lactams vs vancomycin) on the outcome of 342 patients
with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (50.9% with
methicillin-resistant isolates) encountered between 1 January 2002 and
30 June 2003. Initial antibiotics were inappropriate (beta-lactams) in
60 (34.5%) methicillin-resistant cases and suboptimal (vancomycin) in
62 (36.9%) methicillin-susceptible cases. Time to effective antibiotic
therapy was longer in methicillin-resistant cases (25.5+/-28.6 vs
9.6+/-16.6 h; p<0.0005). All-cause in-hospital mortality was higher
with inappropriate therapy (35.0 vs 20.9%; p=0.02). Initial vancomycin
treatment was associated with a higher incidence of delayed clearance
(>or=3 days) of methicillin-susceptible bacteremia (56.3 vs 37.0%;
p=0.03). The results indicate inappropriate initial therapy is
associated with higher in-hospital mortality and initial vancomycin
may delay clearance.

AB  - The goal of this study was to develop and validate clinical prediction
rules for bacteremia and subtypes of bacteremia in patients with
sepsis syndrome. Thus, a prospective cohort study, including a
stratified random sample of 1342 episodes of sepsis syndrome, was done
in eight academic tertiary care hospitals. The derivation set included
881 episodes, and the validation set included 461. Main outcome
measures were bacteremia caused by any organism, gram-negative rods,
gram-positive cocci, and fungal bloodstream infection. The spread in
probability between low- and high-risk groups in the derivation sets
was from 14.5% to 60.6% for bacteremia of any type, from 9.8% to 32.8%
for gram-positive bacteremia, from 5.3% to 41.9% for gram-negative
bacteremia, and from 0.6% to 26.1% for fungemia. Because the model for
gram-positive bacteremia performed poorly, a model predicting
Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia was developed; it performed better,
with a low- to high-risk spread of from 2.6% to 21.0%. The prediction
models allow stratification of patients according to risk of
bloodstream infections; their clinical utility remains to be
demonstrated.

AB  - BACKGROUND

The correlations between time to positivity (TTP) in blood cultures,
the number of positive bottles, and their associations with mortality
rates and metastatic lesion formation in Staphylococcus aureus (S.
aureus) bacteremia remain unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the
impact of these factors on the severity, mortality, and frequency of
metastatic lesions.

PATIENTS AND METHODS

We retrospectively analyzed patients with S. aureus bacteremia who
were admitted to our facility.

RESULTS

A total of 317 patients were included in this study, with an average
age of 70.3 years (standard deviation [SD]: 17.0); 62.5 % were male,
and 22.4 % of cases involved methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus infections. The average TTP was 19.9 h (SD: 11.9). No
significant differences were observed in mortality or severity with
respect to TTP or number of positive bottles. Further investigation
into the relationship with metastatic lesions revealed that the TTP
for patients with intravascular infections was significantly shorter,
averaging 16.81 h (SD: 5.68), compared to 23.45 h (SD: 13.84) in
patients with bacteremia. The TTP for bone and joint infections was
significantly shorter, averaging 17.88 h (SD: 8.26). A weak
correlation was observed between TTP and the number of metastatic
lesions (r = 0.203). Additionally, a weak correlation was found
between TTP and the number of positive bottles (r = 0.544).

CONCLUSION

TTP and bottle count did not predict the severity or mortality of S.
aureus bacteremia in our study. However, positivity with a shorter
TTP, particularly around or below 20 h, warrants further evaluation
for intravascular and bone infections.

AB  - ABSTRACT The time to antibiotic administration (TTA) has been proposed
as a quality-of-care measure in febrile neutropenia (FN); however, few
data regarding the impact of the TTA on the mortality of adult cancer
patients with FN are available. The objective of this study was to
determine whether the TTA is a predictor of mortality in adult cancer
patients with FN. A prospective cohort study of all consecutive cases
of FN, evaluated from October 2009 to August 2011, at a single
tertiary referral hospital in southern Brazil was performed. The TTA
was assessed as a predictive factor for mortality within 28 days of FN
onset using the Cox proportional hazards model. Kaplan-Meier curves
were used for an assessment of the mortality rates according to
different TTAs; the log-rank test was used for between-group
comparisons. In total, 307 cases of FN (169 subjects) were evaluated.
During the study period, there were 29 deaths. In a Cox regression
analysis, the TTA was independently associated with mortality within
28 days (hazard ratio [HR], 1.18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10
to 1.26); each increase of 1 h in the TTA raised the risk of mortality
within 28 days by 18%. Patients with FN episodes with a TTA of ≤30 min
had lower 28-day mortality rates than those with a TTA of between 31
min and 60 min (3.0% versus 18.1%; log-rank P = 0.0002). Early
antibiotic administration was associated with higher survival rates in
the context of FN. Efforts should be made to ensure that FN patients
receive effective antibiotic therapy as soon as possible. A target of
30 min to the TTA should be adopted for cancer patients with FN.

AB  - Abstract Background Sepsis is a leading cause of morbidity, mortality,
and health care costs worldwide. Methods We conducted a multicenter,
prospective cohort study evaluating the yield of blood cultures drawn
before and after empiric antimicrobial administration among adults
presenting to the emergency department with severe manifestations of
sepsis. Enrolled patients who had the requisite blood cultures drawn
were followed for 90 days. We explored the independent association
between blood culture positivity and its time to positivity in
relation to 90-day mortality. Results Three hundred twenty-five
participants were enrolled; 90-day mortality among the 315 subjects
followed up was 25.4% (80/315). Mortality was associated with age
(mean age [standard deviation] in those who died was 72.5 [15.8]
compared with 62.9 [17.7] years among survivors; P < .0001), greater
Charlson Comorbidity Index (2 [interquartile range {IQR}, 1–3] vs 1
[IQR, 0–3]; P = .008), dementia (13/80 [16.2%] vs 18/235 [7.7%]; P =
.03), cancer (27/80 [33.8%] vs 47/235 [20.0%]; P = .015), positive
quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (57/80 [71.2%] vs
129/235 [54.9%]; P = .009), and normal white blood cell count (25/80
[31.2%] vs 42/235 [17.9%]; P = .02). The presence of bacteremia,
persistent bacteremia after antimicrobial infusion, and shorter time
to blood culture positivity were not associated with mortality.
Neither the source of infection nor pathogen affected mortality.
Conclusions Although severe sepsis is an inflammatory condition
triggered by infection, its 90-day survival is not influenced by blood
culture positivity nor its time to positivity. Clinical Trials

AB  - OBJECTIVE To describe the impact of rapid diagnostic microarray
technology and antimicrobial stewardship for patients with
Gram-positive blood cultures. DESIGN Retrospective
pre-intervention/post-intervention study. SETTING A 1,200-bed academic
medical center. PATIENTS Inpatients with blood cultures positive for
Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium,
Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. anginosus,
Streptococcus spp., and Listeria monocytogenes during the 6 months
before and after implementation of Verigene Gram-positive blood
culture microarray (BC-GP) with an antimicrobial stewardship
intervention. METHODS Before the intervention, no rapid diagnostic
technology was used or antimicrobial stewardship intervention was
undertaken, except for the use of peptide nucleic acid fluorescent in
situ hybridization and MRSA agar to identify staphylococcal isolates.
After the intervention, all Gram-positive blood cultures underwent
BC-GP microarray and the antimicrobial stewardship intervention
consisting of real-time notification and pharmacist review. RESULTS In
total, 513 patients with bacteremia were included in this study: 280
patients with S. aureus, 150 patients with enterococci, 82 patients
with stretococci, and 1 patient with L. monocytogenes. The number of
antimicrobial switches was similar in the pre–BC-GP (52%; 155 of 300)
and post–BC-GP (50%; 107 of 213) periods. The time to antimicrobial
switch was significantly shorter in the post–BC-GP group than in the
pre–BC-GP group: 48±41 hours versus 75±46 hours, respectively
(P<.001). The most common antimicrobial switch was de-escalation and
time to de-escalation, was significantly shorter in the post-BC-GP
group than in the pre–BC-GP group: 53±41 hours versus 82±48 hours,
respectively (P<.001). There was no difference in mortality or
hospital length of stay as a result of the intervention. CONCLUSIONS
The combination of a rapid microarray diagnostic test with an
antimicrobial stewardship intervention improved time to antimicrobial
switch, especially time to de-escalation to optimal therapy, in
patients with Gram-positive blood cultures. Infect Control Hosp

fifty–bed academic hospital. Patients:One thousand fifty-eight
consecutive blood culture positive patients. Interventions:We
retrospectively identified adult patients with severe sepsis or septic
shock. Timing of appropriate antibiotic therapy was determined from
blood culture collection time to the administration of the first dose
of antibiotic therapy with documented in vitro susceptibility against
the identified pathogen. We constructed generalized linear models to
examine the determinants of attributable lengths of stay. Measurements
and Main Results:The median (interquartile range) time from blood
culture collection to the administration of appropriate antibiotic
therapy was 6.7 hours (0.0–23.3 hr). Linear regression analysis
adjusting for severity of illness and comorbid conditions identified
time to appropriate antibiotic therapy to be an independent
determinant of postinfection ICU length of stay (0.095-d increase per
hr of time to deliver appropriate antibiotic therapy; 95% CI,
0.057–0.132 d; p < 0.001) and postinfection hospital length of stay
(0.134-d increase per hr of time to deliver appropriate antibiotic
therapy; 95% CI, 0.074–0.194 d; p < 0.001). Other independent
determinants associated with increasing ICU length of stay and
hospital length of stay were mechanical ventilation (both ICU and
hospital lengths of stay) and incremental peak WBC counts (hospital
length of stay only). Incremental changes in severity of illness
assessed by Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores
and comorbidity burden assessed by the Charlson comorbidity score were
independently associated with decreases in ICU length of stay and
hospital length of stay. Conclusions:We identified time to appropriate
antibiotic therapy in patients with sepsis to be an independent
determinant of postinfection ICU and hospital lengths of stay.
Clinicians should implement local strategies aimed at timely delivery
of appropriate antibiotic therapy to improve outcomes and reduce
length of stay.

AB  - Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia often persists. The reasons for
persistence and its outcome are poorly defined. We conducted a
prospective-observational study among 245 consecutive S. aureus (MRSA:
n=125; MSSA: n=120) bacteremias (≥1 positive blood cultures (BC))
among 234 adults (18–103-y-old; median = 59 y) hospitalized during 1
January 2002–31 December 2002 at a 600-bed teaching hospital.
Measurements included bacteremia duration, complication-rate
(metastatic infection, relapse or attributable mortality) and outcome.
Bacteremia duration was measured based on follow-up BC among 193
patients and estimated based on symptoms resolution in the rest.
Measured (1–59 d; median = 2) and estimated (median = 1 d) duration
correlated (r=0.885) though positive follow-up BC was often detected
without fever (57/105 patients, 54.3%). Persistence (defined as
bacteremia for ≥3 d) was noted in 84 cases (38.4%). Complication-rate
increased steadily with bacteremia duration (6.6%, 24.0% and 37.7% in
bacteremia for 1–2, 3 and ≥4 d, respectively; p=0.05). Cox regression
analysis revealed that bacteremia duration correlated positively with
endovascular sources (p=0.006), vancomycin treatment (p=0.016),
cardiovascular prosthesis (p=0.025), metastatic infections (p=0.025)
and diabetes (p=0.038). It is concluded that persistent bacteremia is
a feature of S. aureus infection, irrespective of oxacillin
susceptibility, associated with worse outcome. Risk factors include
endovascular sources, cardiovascular prosthesis, metastatic
infections, vancomycin treatment and diabetes. Patients at risk may
benefit from novel treatment strategies.

AB  - Key Points Question In patients with gram-negative bacterial
bloodstream infections, is obtaining follow-up blood cultures after
the initial positive blood cultures associated with decreased patient
mortality? Findings In this systematic review and meta-analysis that
included 5 observational studies and 4378 patients in the primary
analysis, obtaining follow-up blood cultures was associated with
decreased patient mortality. The overall strength of evidence for the
association of obtaining follow-up blood cultures with decreased
mortality was moderate. Meaning The findings of this study suggest
that well-designed observational studies support the use of follow-up
blood cultures in patients with gram-negative bloodstream infections;
however, subgroup analyses that identify patients who do not require
follow-up blood cultures are lacking.

AB  - BACKGROUND

Continuous monitoring systems have allowed determination of the
time-to-positivity (TTP). We evaluated the clinical relevance of TTP
in the BACTEC9240 system (Becton-Dickinson, USA).

METHODS

A total of 2,354 vials of positive blood cultures were evaluated over
2 months. TTP was monitored from each of BACTEC Plus Aerobic/F (BD) or
Pediatric Plus/F and Lytic Anaerobic/F bottles, and the differential
time-to-positivity (DTP) for blood samples drawn simultaneously via
catheter and a peripheral site was determined.

RESULTS

The average TTP of the positive vials was 17.4 hr, and 79.9% and 95.2%
of the vials showed positivity within 24 and 48 hr, respectively.
While the average TTP values for Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus
cereus, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were
less than 10 hr, those for Candida spp., anaerobes, Propionibacterium
acnes, Corynebacterium spp, Bacillus spp. other than cereus, and
coagulase-negative staphylococci were 35.3, 27.0, 56.8, 45.8, 23.0,
and 26.3 hr, respectively. The negative predictive values of TTP over
24 hr to predict Staphylococcus aureus among staphylococci and S.
pneumoniae among alpha-hemolytic streptococci were 76.7% and 100%,
respectively. Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcus faecalis showed
shorter TTP in anaerobic vials than in aerobic vials. DTP of more than
2 hr was observed for 27.8%, 72.2%, and 45.5% of S. aureus, S.
epidermidis, and Candida spp.

CONCLUSIONS

TTP can be used to discriminate pathogens and contaminants. The
shorter TTP in anaerobic vials of certain Enterobacteriaceae and
Enterococcus spp. would facilitate further identification. DTP is
useful for diagnosing catheter-related bloodstream infection by S.
aureus, S. epidermidis, and Candida spp.

AB  - OBJECTIVES

To determine whether time-to-positivity (TTP) in aerobic and anaerobic
blood culture vials is useful to predict the presence of Candida
glabrata in patients with candidaemia.

METHODS

TTP was recorded for both aerobic and anaerobic vials for each blood
culture set of monomicrobial candidaemia. We considered TTP as the
shortest time registered for any positive vial. Two diagnostic
criteria were evaluated: the cut-off TTP value as obtained from a
receiver operating characteristic curve and the detection of growth
only or with a shorter TTP in anaerobic vials.

RESULTS

A total of 157 episodes were analysed of which 19 (12.1%) were due to
C. glabrata. The TTP for C. glabrata was longer than that for other
species. C. glabrata grew more frequently than other species in
anaerobic vials [9/19 (47%) versus 19/138 (14%); P = 0.001] and also
more often exclusively or earlier in anaerobic vials [7/19 (37%)
versus 5/138 (4%); P < 0.0001]. The sensitivity, specificity, positive
predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of a TTP
>56.5 h for predicting the presence of C. glabrata were 47%, 88%, 36%
and 92%, respectively. Growth detection only or earlier in anaerobic
flasks had a sensitivity of 37%, a specificity of 96%, a PPV of 58%
and an NPV of 92%.

CONCLUSIONS

Using the BACTEC 9240 system, a TTP ≤ 56.5 h is useful to rule out C.
glabrata. In addition, in settings with an ~12% prevalence of C.
glabrata candidaemia, yeast detection exclusively or earlier in
anaerobic vials increases the probability of the presence of C.
glabrata to 58%, which may be useful for early treatment optimization.

AB  - BACKGROUND

To evaluate the short-term and long-term outcomes of patients with
suspected bacteremia, we performed a prospective cohort study.

METHODS

Clinical data were collected within 24 hours of initial culture from a
random sample of 1516 episodes in which blood cultures were performed
in an urban tertiary care hospital. One hundred forty-two patients
with bacteremia were compared with two comparison groups: (1) 142
randomly selected patients with negative cultures, matched in age
within 5 years, gender, severity of underlying disease, and presence
of major comorbidity, and (2) all 155 patients with contaminant
cultures. The main outcome measures were death, death secondary to
bacteremia, and major complications.

RESULTS

In the 439 patients, there were 142 deaths (32%), 114 at 1 year (26%)
and 46 within 30 days (11%). Mortality at 30 days was most highly
correlated with predicted fatality of underlying disease: 48% for the
65 patients with a rapidly fatal disease, 9% for the 156 patients with
an eventually fatal disease, and 0.5% for the 217 patients with no
fatal disease. In a Cox survival analysis, the risk ratio associated
with bacteremia was 1.6 (95% confidence interval, 1.0 to 2.4) vs the
comparison groups. When we performed time-dependent Cox analyses in
which the hazard ratio was allowed to change at 30 days, we found that
the risk ratios associated with bacteremia were 2.3 (95% confidence
interval, 1.2 to 4.4) for the first 30 days, and 1.3 (95% confidence
interval, 0.76 to 2.1) after 30 days.

CONCLUSIONS

We conclude that this population has a high mortality, which is
strongly correlated with severity of underlying disease. Short-term
mortality was higher in patients with bacteremia even after
controlling for severity of illness, but the increase in risk was
present only during the first month and most deaths occurred in
patients with a rapidly fatal disease.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objectives: To compare antimicrobial and resource utilization
with T2 Magnetic Resonance (T2MR) versus blood culture (BC) in
patients with suspected bloodstream infection. Methods: We
systematically searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL for randomized
trials or observational controlled studies of patients with suspected
bloodstream infection receiving a diagnosis with T2MR or BC. Using an
inverse variance meta-analysis model, we reported mortality using the
risk ratio (RR) and the remaining outcomes as the mean difference
(MD). Results: Fourteen studies were included in the meta-analysis.
Time to detection (MD = −81 hours; p < 0.001) and time to species
identification (MD = −77 hours; p < 0.001) were faster with T2MR.
Patients testing positive on T2MR received targeted antimicrobial
therapy faster (−42 hours; p < 0.001) and patients testing negative on
T2MR were de-escalated from empirical therapy faster (−7 hours; p =
0.02) vs. BC. Length of intensive care unit stay (MD = −5.0 days; p =
0.03) and hospital stay (MD = −4.8 days; p = 0.03) were shorter with
T2MR. Mortality rates were comparable between T2MR and BC (28.9% vs.
29.9%, RR = 1.02, p = 0.86). Conclusion: Utilization of T2MR for
identification of bloodstream pathogens provides faster time to
detection, faster transition to targeted microbial therapy, faster
de-escalation of empirical therapy, shorter ICU and hospital stay, and
with comparable mortality rate versus BC.

AB  - HYPOTHESIS

A set of clinical variables available at the bedside can be used to
predict outcome in critically ill patients with bloodstream infection
(BSI).

DESIGN

A 3-year retrospective cohort study.

SETTING

A surgical intensive care unit in Switzerland.

PATIENTS

All patients with BSI were potentially eligible.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES

Clinical variables, organ dysfunctions, and outcome.

RESULTS

Among 4530 admissions to the surgical intensive care unit, 224
clinically significant episodes of BSI were recorded (incidence,
4.9%), with a 28-day fatality of 36%. A total of 110 patients had
primary bacteremia, of which 39 (35%) were catheter related. Although
gram-positive organisms were the most frequently isolated pathogens
(58% [159/275]), they were associated with lower case-fatality (30%)
than BSI due to gram-negative bacteria (44%). Organ dysfunctions
associated with the highest risk of death were neurologic dysfunction
(hazard ratio [HR], 6.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.3-14.5),
hepatic dysfunction (HR, 3.9; 95% CI, 2.1-7.4), and disseminated
intravascular coagulation (HR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.5-6.1). By multivariate
analysis, 2 independent predictors of mortality were the APACHE II
(Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II) score at onset of
BSI (HR per 1-point increase, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.04-1.12) and the number
of evolving organ dysfunctions (HR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.2-1.7). Appropriate
antimicrobial therapy was associated with improved outcome (HR, 0.4;
95% CI, 0.2-0.6).

CONCLUSIONS

Bloodstream infection in critically ill patients is a common and
frequently fatal condition. Its outcome can be predicted by the
severity of illness at onset of BSI and the number of organ
dysfunctions evolving thereafter. Appropriate antimicrobial therapy is
an important determinant for survival.

AB  - ABSTRACT Increasing bacterial antimicrobial resistance has prompted
physicians to choose broad-spectrum antimicrobials in order to reduce
the likelihood of inactive empirical therapy. However, for bacteremic
patients already receiving supportive care, it is unclear whether
delay of active antimicrobial therapy significantly impacts patient
outcomes. We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients with
monomicrobial bloodstream infections at a large urban hospital in the
United States from 2001 to 2006. We assessed the impact of delay of
active antimicrobial therapy on mortality by using multivariable
logistic regression modeling with and without propensity score
methodology. We evaluated 1,523 episodes of monomicrobial bacterial
bloodstream infections at our institution. Nine hundred eighty-three
bacteremic episodes (64.5%) were treated with an active antimicrobial
agent within 24 h of the index blood culture; the remaining 540
episodes (35.5%) were considered to have delay of active antimicrobial
therapy. In adjusted analysis, among patients in the
non-intensive-care-unit setting with an absolute neutrophil count
(ANC) of <100 cells/μl, delay was associated with increased mortality
(odds ratio [OR], 18.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.84 to 114.5; P
< 0.01); among intensive-care-unit patients with an ANC of <100
cells/μl, the effect of delay on mortality was nearly significant (OR,
5.56; 95% CI, 0.85 to 36.3; P = 0.07). However, for patients who were
nonneutropenic (ANC, >500 cells/μl) or had ANCs of 100 to 500
cells/μl, delay was not associated with increased mortality. While the
delay of active antimicrobial therapy was not significantly associated
with higher mortality for most patients in this cohort, patients with
severe neutropenia appeared to be vulnerable.

AB  - PURPOSE

Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia (SAB) may be complicated by
secondary metastatic infection such as endocarditis, osteomyelitis or
septic arthritis. This cohort study aimed to assess the prognostic
value of sustained bacteraemia for outcomes related to Staphylococcus
aureus bacteraemia.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS

The study took place in three tertiary-care, university-affiliated
hospitals. Patients were prospectively included if they agreed to
participate and if the following data were available: (a).
surveillance blood culture taken between 24 and 48 h after
commencement of effective antibiotic therapy; (b). appropriate
investigations (at least a TTE) performed as suggested by the
infectious diseases consult service. Patients with sustained
bacteraemia defined as persistent positive blood cultures more than 24
h after commencement of effective antibiotic therapy were compared to
patients for whom the surveillance blood culture was negative.

RESULTS

One hundred and four patients were enrolled, including 51 patients
diagnosed with sustained bacteraemia. Sustained bacteraemia was
significantly associated with a higher frequency of secondary
metastatic infection (p<0.001) and with a higher frequency of CRP>100
mg/l. Frequency of acute complications due to infection, septic shock
and death due to bacteraemia was higher for patients with sustained
bacteraemia but this difference was not statistically significant.
Using a Cox model, the risk for death associated with sustained SAB,
controlling for Index of comorbidity and age (categorised as<or>or=70
years), was 1.2 (95% CI: (0.5, 3); p>0.05).

CONCLUSION

In conclusion, surveillance blood cultures, especially performed on
effective antibiotic therapy, may be a simple and cost-effective way
to select a population at risk for secondary metastatic infection from
SAB.

AB  - OBJECTIVE

To assess the performance of differential time to positivity (DTP) for
the diagnosis of catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI).

METHODS

From all episodes of bloodstream infections (BSI) diagnosed during a
15-year period (2003-17) those in which a paired set of blood cultures
drawn from a catheter and a peripheral vein were positive for the same
microorganism and had a clinically and/or microbiologically defined
source were selected. To assess diagnostic discrimination ability and
accuracy of DTP for CRBSI, area under the receiver operating
characteristic curves (AUC) and performance characteristics of a DTP
≥2 h were computed.

RESULTS

A total of 512 BSI were included, of which 302 (59%) were CRBSI.
Discrimination ability of DTP was low for Staphylococcus aureus (AUC
0.656 ± 0.06), coagulase-negative staphylococci (AUC 0.618 ± 0.081),
enterococci (AUC 0.554 ± 0.117) and non-AmpC-producing
Enterobacteriaceae (AUC 0.653 ± 0.053); moderate for Pseudomonas
aeruginosa (AUC 0.841 ± 0.073), and high for AmpC-producing
Enterobacteriaceae (AUC 0.944 ± 0.039). For the entire sample, DTP had
a low-to-moderate discrimination ability (AUC 0.698 ± 0.024). A DTP
≥2 h has a low sensitivity for coagulase-negative staphylococci (60%)
and very low for S. aureus (34%), enterococci (40%) and
non-AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae (42%). A DTP cut-off of 1 h
improved sensitivity (90%) for AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae.

CONCLUSIONS

Differential time to positivity performs well for diagnosing CRBSI
only when AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa are
involved. Performance is low for common Gram-positive organisms and
non-AmpC-producing enteric bacilli; a negative test should not be used
to rule out CRBSI due to these microorganisms. A DTP ≥1 h may improve
accuracy for AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae, particularly
Enterobacter spp.

significant pathogens were detected within 3 days of incubation using
a continuous monitoring automated blood culture instrument. Objectives
To determine time to blood culture positivity (TTP) of microorganisms
using a BD BACTEC™ FX. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted
at Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital, Thailand from October to
November 2014. Results One-hundred and eighty-one patients with 195
episodes of infection and 436 cultures were included in the analysis.
Among 181 patients, 55.2% were male and the median age was 61 years
(interquartile range (IQR) 50, 76). Of the 195 episodes of infections,
the most common source was genitourinary tract (15.4%). Overall, the
median TTP was 17 hours (IQR 11.5, 24.5), the shortest TTP was
observed in Streptococcus agalactiae. Four-hundred and seventy-eight
cultures (97.6%) and all (100%) were detected at 3 days and 5 days of
incubation. Factors associated with TTP ≤24 hour were blood drawn from
patients who had hematologic malignancy (odds ratio (OR) 9.6, 95%
confidence interval (CI) 1.2, 74.3, P = 0.030), endocarditis and
vascular infection (OR 8.7, 95% CI 1.1, 67.2, P = 0.038),
thrombocytopenia (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.3, 4.4, P = 0.004), clinical of
systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.2,
4.5, P = 0.014), and not receiving antimicrobials within 72 hours
before cultures taken (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.4, 3.6, P < 0.001).
Conclusions TTP varied depends upon the pathogens and clinical
settings. However, bacteria were isolated from almost, but not all of
the blood cultures within 3 days of incubation.

AB  - OBJECTIVES

Early broad-spectrum antimicrobial treatment reduces mortality in
patients with septic shock. In a multicenter, prospective
observational study, we explored whether delayed appropriate
antimicrobial therapy (AAT) influences outcome in Staphylococcus
aureus bloodstream infection (SAB).

METHODS

Two hundred and fifty-six patients with SAB from ten German study
centers were enrolled and followed for 3 months. Predisposing factors,
clinical features, diagnostic procedures, antimicrobial therapy, and
outcome were recorded. The appropriateness of antimicrobial therapy
was judged by a trained physician based on in vitro activity, dosage,
and duration of therapy. Therapy was considered to be delayed when
more than 24 h elapsed between the first positive blood culture and
the start of appropriate therapy. The association of delayed therapy
with overall mortality and SAB-related events (i.e., attributable
mortality or late SAB-related complications) was assessed by
crosstabulation and propensity score-based logistic regression.

RESULTS

One hundred and sixty-eight patients received AAT during their
hospital stay, of whom 42 (25%) received delayed AAT. The overall
mortality and the occurrence of severe sepsis or septic shock were
lower in patients with delayed AAT, pointing towards confounding by
indication. Adjusted 90-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.91,
95% confidence interval [CI] [0.39-2.13], p 0.82) and SAB-related
events (adjusted OR 1.46, 95% CI [0.47-4.51], p 0.52) also failed to
show a significant impact of delayed AAT on outcome.

CONCLUSION

In patients with SAB, early AAT may not improve survival. However,
confounding by indication is a major challenge when analyzing and
interpreting observational studies on the impact of delayed AAT.

AB  - Abstract Background Effective antimicrobial treatment is key for
survival in bloodstream infection (BSI), but the impact of timing of
treatment remains unclear. Our aim was to assess the association
between time to appropriate antimicrobial treatment and 30-day
mortality in BSI patients. Methods This was a retrospective cohort
study using electronic health record data from a large academic center
in Sweden. Adult patients admitted between the years 2012 and 2019,
with onset of BSI at the emergency department or general wards, were
included. Pathogen-antimicrobial drug combinations were classified as
appropriate or inappropriate based on reported in vitro
susceptibilities. To avoid immortal time bias, the association between
appropriate therapy and mortality was assessed with multivariable
logistic regression analysis at pre-specified landmark times. Results
We included 10 628 BSI-episodes, occurring in 9192 unique patients.
The overall 30-day mortality was 11.8%. No association in favor of a
protective effect between appropriate therapy and mortality was found
at the 1, 3 and 6 hours landmark after blood culture collection. At 12
hours, the risk of death increased with inappropriate treatment
(adjusted odds ratio 1.17 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.01–1.37])
and continued to increase gradually at 24, 48, and 72 hours.
Stratifying by high or low SOFA score generated similar odds ratios,
with wider confidence intervals. Conclusions Delays in appropriate
antimicrobial treatment were associated with increased 30-day
mortality after 12 hours from blood culture collection, but not at 1,
3, and 6 hours, in BSI. These results indicate a benchmark for
providing rapid microbiological diagnostics of blood cultures.

AB  - OBJECTIVES

We sought to determine the impact of timing of appropriate antifungal
therapy, as assessed by susceptibility results, on patient survival.

METHODS

Patients ≥16 years of age with first episodes of candidaemia during
2001-09 were included. Clinical data were collected retrospectively,
including time to appropriate antifungal therapy and patient survival.

RESULTS

The study population included 446 patients [243 (54%) female, mean age
53 years] with candidaemia, 380 (85%) of whom had antifungal
susceptibility data. Candida albicans was the most common pathogen
(221, 50%) followed by Candida glabrata (99, 22%), Candida
parapsilosis (59, 13%), Candida tropicalis (48, 11%) and Candida
krusei (6, 1%). Appropriate antifungal therapy consisted of
fluconazole (177, 40%), an echinocandin (125, 28%), amphotericin B
(41, 9%) and voriconazole (6, 1%); 97 (22%) failed to receive
appropriate antifungal therapy. The 30 day mortality was 34% (151/446)
and there was no clear relationship between time from positive culture
to receipt of appropriate antifungal therapy and 30 day survival. On
multivariable Cox regression, increased APACHE II score [hazard ratio
(HR) 1.11, 95% CI 1.09-1.13, P<0.001], cirrhosis (HR 2.15, 95% CI
1.48-3.13, P<0.001) and HIV infection (HR 2.03, 95% CI 1.11-3.72,
P=0.02) were independent predictors of mortality. A secondary analysis
requiring patients in the early treatment group to have received ≥24 h
of effective antifungal therapy did show a significant mortality
benefit to receiving antifungal treatment within 72 h of a positive
blood culture being drawn (30 day mortality for early treatment: 27%
versus 40%, P=0.004; HR for mortality with delayed treatment on
multivariable analysis: 1.41, 95% CI 1.01-1.98, P=0.045).

CONCLUSIONS

Candida bloodstream infection is associated with high mortality,
despite timely receipt of appropriate antifungal therapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND

Vancomycin susceptibility, the accessory gene global regulator (agr)
genotype and function, staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCC) mec
type, and susceptibility to cationic thrombin-induced platelet
microbicidal protein 1 (tPMP-1) have been individually predictive of
duration of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)
bacteremia. This investigation evaluated the interrelationship of
these factors with time to clearance of MRSA bacteremia during
vancomycin therapy in patients without endocarditis.

METHODS

Vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration and in vitro killing, agr
function (delta-hemolysin activity), agr group, SCCmec type, and
survival in tPMP-1 killing assays were determined for 29 MRSA
bacteremia isolates.

RESULTS

Increased resistance to tPMP-1 killing was observed with agr group III
MRSA (P = .025) and MRSA with reduced or absent agr function (P =
.023). The median time to clearance of MRSA bacteremia was earlier for
agr group III (3 days) versus group I (10.5 days) or II (15 days) (P =
.001). In multivariate analysis, agr group II, reduced tPMP-1 killing
in vitro, and prior vancomycin exposure were significant independent
predictors of longer MRSA bacteremia duration.

CONCLUSIONS

Specific genotypic, phenotypic, and clinical parameters appear to
correlate with persistent MRSA bacteremia. The interrelationship of
these and other factors probably contributes to vancomycin-mediated
clearance of MRSA bacteremia.

AB  - INTRODUCTION

Early antibiotic treatment failure (EATF) is a clinically important
concept but remains underrecognized among frontline physicians.
Moreover, no validated prediction models currently exist that
specifically target EATF in patients with bacteremia. The present
study aims to develop and internally validate a clinical prediction
model for EATF in hospitalized adults with bacteremia.

METHODS

This multicenter retrospective cohort study included adult inpatients
with bacteremia from the Japan Bacteremia Inpatient Cohort Association
(JA-BICA), conducted across eight community hospitals in Japan from
2018 to 2022. Based on review results, we defined EATF as an outcome
that included changes in antibiotics and advanced treatment after 72
hours of admission. Using 28 candidate variables from previous
studies, models, and clinical expertise, we developed our model
through backward elimination based on the Akaike Information
Criterion. After constructing the score model, discrimination was
assessed using the area under the curve (AUC), while calibration was
evaluated using a plot. Internal validation used the bootstrap method
to assess AUC and overfitting.

RESULTS

Among the 1,084 eligible patients, 388 experienced EATF. The model
included abnormal white blood cell count, low serum albumin, occlusive
lesions, transfer admission, and oxygen therapy. Internal validation
demonstrated an AUC of 0.66, 95% confidence interval (0.62, 0.69), and
a calibration slope of 1.01.

CONCLUSIONS

Although the model's discrimination was modest, this study highlights
the importance of EATF as a clinical outcome and demonstrates the
inherent difficulty of developing predictive models for bacteremia.
External validation is warranted.

AB  - PURPOSE

Optimal antimicrobial treatment duration for Gram-negative bloodstream
infection (BSI) remains unclear. This retrospective cohort study
examined effectiveness of short (7-10 days) and long (>10 days)
courses of antimicrobial therapy for uncomplicated Gram-negative BSI.

METHODS

Hospitalized adults with uncomplicated Gram-negative BSI at Palmetto
Health hospitals in Columbia SC, USA from January 1, 2010 to December
31, 2013 were identified. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards
regression with propensity score adjustment was used to examine risk
of treatment failure in the two groups.

RESULTS

During the study period, 117 and 294 patients received short and long
courses of antimicrobial therapy for uncomplicated Gram-negative BSI,
respectively. Overall, the median age was 67 years, 258 (63%) were
women, 282 (69%) had urinary source of infection, and 271 (66%) had
BSI due to Escherichia coli. The median duration of antimicrobial
therapy was 8.5 and 13.3 days in the short and long treatment groups,
respectively. After adjustment for the propensity to use a short
course of therapy, risk of treatment failure was higher in patients
receiving short compared to long courses of antimicrobial agents (HR
2.60, 95% CI: 1.20-5.53, p = 0.02). Other risk factors for treatment
failure included liver cirrhosis (HR 5.83, 95% CI: 1.89-15.02,
p = 0.004) and immune compromised status (HR 4.30, 95% CI: 1.57-10.80,
p = 0.006). Definitive antimicrobial therapy with intravenous or
highly bioavailable oral agents was associated with reduced risk of
treatment failure (HR 0.33, 95% CI: 0.14-0.73, p = 0.006).

CONCLUSIONS

The current results support common clinical practice of 2 weeks of
antimicrobial therapy for uncomplicated Gram-negative BSI.

case for enterococci or streptoccoci that are also high risk organism.
Time to blood culture positivity (TTP) reflects bacterial load and has
the potential to identify patients at higher risk of endocarditis.
Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of clinical data that
have been performed in a tertiary hospital in England. We investigate
time to positivity (TTP) as a predictor variable in our S. aureus,
enterococci and streptococci in logistic regression models and assess
non-linearity of this affect using generalised additive models. We
calculate NPV for TTP beyond the median value. Results The odds ratio
for endocarditis from S. aureus bacteria was 0.92 (95%CI 0.85-0.99, p
= 0.02) for each hour increase in TTP, with a negative predictive
value of TTP greater than the median being 90% (95% CI 85-95%). For
streptococci the OR was 1.02 (95%CI 0.98-1.06, p:0.31) and enterococci
1.08 (95% CI 0.99-1.18, p = 0.1) for every increase in hour of TTP.
Conclusion Longer TTP is associated with lower risk of endocarditis in
S. aureus bacteraemia, at 8% reduction per hour, giving an NPV of 90%
beyond 13 hours. There was no evidence of association with enterococci
or streptococci.

AB  - Aim To identify predictors of bacteremia in critically ill patients,
to evaluate the impact of blood cultures on the outcome, and to define
conditions for breakthrough bacteremia despite concurrent antibiotic
treatment. Methods A descriptive retrospective study was performed
over a two-year period (2007-2008) in the medico-surgical Intensive
Care Unit (ICU) of the San Giovanni Hospital in Bellinzona,
Switzerland. Results Forty-five out of 231 patients (19.5%) had
positive blood cultures. Predictors of positive blood cultures were
elevated procalcitonin levels (>2 µg/L, P < 0.001), higher severity
scores (Simplified Acute Physiology Score II>43, P = 0.014; Sequential
Organ Failure Assessment >4.0, P < 0.001), and liver failure
(P = 0.028). Patients with bacteremia had longer hospital stays (31 vs
21 days, P = 0.058), but their mortality was not different from
patients without bacteremia. Fever (t > 38.5°C) only showed a trend
toward a higher rate of blood culture positivity (P = 0.053). The rate
of positive blood cultures was not affected by concurrent antibiotic
therapy. Conclusions The prediction of positive blood culture results
still remains a very difficult task. In our analysis, blood cultures
were positive in 20% of ICU patients whose blood was cultured, and
positive findings increased with elevated procalcitonin levels, liver
failure, and higher severity scores. Blood cultures drawn >4 days
after the start of antibiotic therapy and >5 days after surgery could
detect pathogens responsible for a new infection complication.

AB  - OBJECTIVES

There is limited evidence that empirical antimicrobials affect
patient-oriented outcomes in Gram-negative bacteraemia. We aimed to
establish the impact of effective antibiotics at four consecutive
timepoints on 30 day all-cause mortality and length of stay in
hospital.

METHODS

We performed a multivariable survival analysis on 789 patients with
Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa
bacteraemias. Antibiotic choices at the time of the blood culture
(BC), the time of medical clerking and 24 and 48 h post-BC were
reviewed.

RESULTS

Patients that received ineffective empirical antibiotics at the time
of the BC had higher risk of mortality before 30 days (HR = 1.68, 95%
CI = 1.19-2.38, P = 0.004). Mortality was higher if an ineffective
antimicrobial was continued by the clerking doctor (HR = 2.73, 95%
CI = 1.58-4.73, P < 0.001) or at 24 h from the BC (HR = 1.83, 95%
CI = 1.05-3.20, P = 0.033) when compared with patients who received
effective therapy throughout. Hospital-onset infections, 'high
inoculum' infections and elevated C-reactive protein, lactate and
Charlson comorbidity index were independent predictors of mortality.
Effective initial antibiotics did not statistically significantly
reduce length of stay in hospital (-2.98 days, 95% CI = -6.08-0.11,
P = 0.058). The primary reasons for incorrect treatment were in vitro
antimicrobial resistance (48.6%), initial misdiagnosis of infection
source (22.7%) and non-adherence to hospital guidelines (15.7%).

CONCLUSIONS

Consecutive prescribing decisions affect mortality from Gram-negative
bacteraemia.

AB  - Abstract Objectives: Evidence supporting collection of follow-up blood
cultures for Gram-negative bacteremia is mixed. We sought to
understand why providers order follow-up blood cultures when managing
P. aeruginosa bacteremia and whether follow-up blood cultures in this
context are associated with short- and long-term survival. Methods: We
conducted a retrospective cohort study of adult inpatients with P.
aeruginosa bacteremia at the University of Maryland Medical Center in
2015–2020. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox regression with
time-varying covariates were used to evaluate the association between
follow-up blood cultures and time to mortality within 30 days of first
positive blood culture. Provider justifications for follow-up blood
cultures were identified through chart review. Results: Of 159
eligible patients, 127 (80%) had follow-up blood cultures, including 9
(7%) that were positive for P. aeruginosa and 10 (8%) that were
positive for other organisms. Follow-up blood cultures were typically
collected “to ensure clearance” or “to guide antibiotic therapy.”
Overall, 30-day mortality was 25.2%. After risk adjustment for patient
characteristics, follow-up blood cultures were associated with a
nonsignificant reduction in mortality risk (hazard ratio, 0.43; 95%
confidence interval, 1.08; P = .071). In exploratory analyses, the
potential mortality reduction from follow-up blood cultures was driven
by their use in patients with Pitt bacteremia scores >0. Conclusions:
Follow-up blood cultures are commonly collected for P. aeruginosa
bacteremia but infrequently identify persistent bacteremia. Targeted
use of follow-up blood cultures based on severity of illness may
reduce unnecessary culturing.

AB  - ABSTRACT Persistent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)
bacteremia (PB) (positive blood cultures after ≥7 days of therapy)
represents a clinically challenging subset of invasive MRSA
infections. In this investigation, we examined the potential
correlation of specific virulence signatures with PB versus resolving
MRSA bacteremia (RB) (negative blood cultures within 2 to 4 days of
therapy) strains. Thirty-six MRSA isolates from patients enrolled in a
recent multinational clinical trial were studied for (i)
susceptibility to host defense cationic peptides (HDPs) (i.e.,
thrombin-induced platelet microbicidal proteins [tPMPs] and human
neutrophil peptide 1 [hNP-1]); (ii) adherence to host endovascular
ligands (fibronectin) and cells (endothelial cells); and (iii) biofilm
formation. We found that PB isolates exhibited significantly reduced
susceptibilities to tPMPs and hNP-1 (P < 0.001 and P = 0.023,
respectively). There was no significant association between the PB
outcome and fibronectin binding, endothelial cell binding, or biofilm
formation (P = 0.25, 0.97, and 0.064 versus RB strains, respectively).
However, multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that the PB
outcome was significantly associated with the combination of reduced
susceptibilities to HDPs and extent of biofilm formation (P < 0.0001).
Similar results were obtained in a second analysis using days of
bacteremia as a continuous outcome, showing that reduced HDP
susceptibilities and increased biofilm formation cocontributed to
predict the duration of bacteremia. Our data indicate that PB isolates
have specific pathogenic signatures independent of conventional
antimicrobial susceptibility. These combinatorial mosaics can be
defined and used to prospectively distinguish PB from RB strains in
advance and potentially to predict ultimate clinical outcomes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE

To identify the clinical and laboratory parameters correlating with
speed of bacterial growth in culture and independent risk factors of
in-hospital mortality in patients with Escherichia coli bacteremia.

METHODS

This retrospective study was conducted at Beijing University Third
Hospital. The medical records and microbiological database of the
patients diagnosed as Escherichia coli bacteremia between January 2007
and December 2009 were collected. The parameter of time to positivity
(TTP) was used to be a surrogate marker of bacterial growth.
Univariate analysis was used to identify relationship between clinical
parameters and the speed of bacterial growth. Logistic multivariate
analysis was used to identify risk factors of in-hospital mortality.

RESULTS

The medical records of 112 patients during the study period were
collected, 25 patients died during hospital stay, the overall
in-hospital mortality rate was 22.3%. Univariate analysis indicated
the rapid-growth (TTP≤7 hours) group (n=20) had higher incidence of
neutropenia (40.0% vs. 15.2%), higher incidence of primary bacteremia
(40.0% vs. 18.5%) and higher in-hospital mortality rate (45.0% vs.
17.4%) than those with slow bacterial growth (TTP>7 hours) group (n
=92, all P<0.05). The death group (n=25) was found to have a higher
incidence of TTP≤7 hours (36.0% vs. 12.6%), higher incidence of active
malignancies (44.0% vs. 24.1%), higher incidence of neutropenia (36.0%
vs. 14.9%), higher rate of isolation of extended spectrum β lactamases
(ESBL)-producing strains (48.0% vs. 24.1%) than the survival group
(n=87, all P<0.05). Logistic multivariate analysis suggested the
significant predictors of in-hospital mortality included TTP≤7 hours
[odds ratio (OR)=3.412, 95% confidence interval (95% CI)=1.1819.856,
P=0.023], ESBL-producing strains (OR=2.545, 95% CI=0.9776.625,
P=0.056).

CONCLUSION

In vitro Escherichia coli growth speed in the blood culture correlates
with the incidence of neutropenia and primary bacteremia, and TTP≤7
hours and ESBL-producing strains may be the strong, independent risk
factors of a worse prognosis in patients with Escherichia coli
bacteremia.

AB  - ABSTRACT The bloodstream infection mortality risk score (BSIMRS)
predicts the outcome of patients with Gram-negative bloodstream
infections (BSI) with high discrimination. This retrospective cohort
study examined the impact of inappropriate antimicrobial therapy on
mortality in adult patients with Gram-negative BSI admitted to
Palmetto Health Hospitals in Columbia, SC, USA, from 1 January 2011 to
31 December 2012 after stratification by predicted prognosis at
initial presentation using BSIMRS. A multivariate Cox regression model
was used to identify independent risk factors for 28-day mortality
overall and within each predefined BSIMRS category (<5, 5 to 9, and
≥10). Relative risk reduction (RRR), absolute risk reduction (ARR),
and number needed to treat (NNT) were calculated from a predictive
logistic regression model of mortality. Overall, 390 unique patients
with first episodes of Gram-negative BSI were identified. The median
age was 66 years, and 229 (59%) were women. There was significant
association between inappropriate antimicrobial therapy and mortality
in patients with BSIMRS of 5 to 9 (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 3.55;
95% confidence intervals [CI], 1.22 to 8.31; P = 0.02) and BSIMRS of
≥10 (aHR, 4.99; 95% CI, 1.09 to 22.87; P = 0.04) but not in those with
BSIMRS of <5 (aHR, 3.34; 95% CI, 0.17 to 22.77; P = 0.34). RRR, ARR,
and NNT were 0.25, 0.02, and 63 for BSIMRS of <5; 0.56, 0.32, and 3
for BSIMRS of 5 to 9; and 0.39, 0.39, and 3 for BSIMRS of ≥10,
respectively. There is a significant benefit from appropriate
antimicrobial therapy in patients with Gram-negative BSI with guarded
(BSIMRS of 5 to 9) and poor (BSIMRS of ≥10) predicted prognosis.
Survival difference remains unclear among those with good predicted
prognosis (BSIMRS of <5) at initial presentation.

AB  - OBJECTIVES

The role of follow-up blood cultures (FUBCs) in the management of
Gram-negative bacteraemia (GNB) is poorly understood. We aimed to
determine the utility of FUBCs in identifying patients with increased
mortality risk.

METHODS

An observational study with a prospectively enrolled cohort of adult
inpatients with GNB was conducted at Duke University Health System
from 2002 to 2015. FUBCs were defined as blood cultures performed from
24 hours to 7 days from initial positive blood culture.

RESULTS

Among 1702 patients with GNB, 1164 (68%) had FUBCs performed. When
performed, FUBCs were positive in 20% (228/1113) of cases. FUBC
acquisition was associated with lower all-cause in-hospital mortality
(108/538, 20%, vs. 176/1164, 15%; p 0.01) and attributable in-hospital
mortality (78/538, 15%, vs. 98/1164, 8%; p < 0.0001). Propensity
score-weighted Cox proportional hazards models revealed that obtaining
FUBCs was associated with reductions in all-cause (hazard ratio (HR)
0.629; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.511-0.772; p < 0.0001) and
attributable mortality (HR 0.628; 95% CI, 0.480-0.820; p 0.0007).
Positive FUBCs were associated with increased all-cause mortality
(49/228, 21%, vs. 110/885, 11%; p 0.0005) and attributable mortality
(27/228, 12%, vs. 61/885, 7%; p 0.01) relative to negative FUBCs.
Propensity score-weighted Cox proportional hazards models revealed
that positive FUBCs were associated with increased all-cause (HR
2.099; 95% CI, 1.567-2.811; p < 0.0001) and attributable mortality (HR
1.800; 95% CI, 1.245-2.603; p 0.002). In a calibration analysis, a
scoring system accurately identified patients at high risk of positive
FUBCs.

CONCLUSIONS

Rates of positive FUBCs were high and identified patients at increased
risk for mortality. Clinical variables can identify patients at high
risk for positive FUBCs. FUBCs should be considered in the management
of GNB.

AB  - Data on time-to-positivity (TTP) of blood cultures has been available
for approximately 25 years, due to continuous monitoring blood-culture
instruments. It is defined as the time from the start of incubation to
a positive signal. It has long been recognized to carry useful
information for patient management that is progressively decrypted
with varying degrees of success. First efforts have focused on early
discrimination between bacterial groups or sources of infection. The
TTP has then constituted the basis of the differential TTP method used
to diagnose catheter-related bloodstream infection [1].

AB  - Antibiotic resistance is common and frequently leads to unintentional
delays in appropriate antibiotic therapy. The detrimental impact of
delayed therapy is well-accepted, but the majority of evidence focuses
on gram-negative infections. A review and synthesis of the evidence
evaluating the impact of delayed appropriate antibiotic therapy in
serious gram-positive infections does not exist. Such data would
define the scope of the problem in this important patient population
where antibiotic resistance is common. The objective of this
systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the impact of
delayed appropriate antibiotic therapy on mortality in patients with
gram-positive bacteremia.

Pubmed and Embase were searched from inception to March 30, 2020 to
identify clinical studies of patients with bacteremia due to
staphylococci, enterococci, or streptococci that reported the
association between delayed appropriate antibiotic therapy and
mortality. Three independent reviewers screened search results. Study
quality was assessed via Newcastle-Ottawa Assessment Scale.
Meta-analyses evaluating association between delayed therapy and
mortality were conducted via random effects models in Review Manager
5.3. The primary analysis included unadjusted effect estimates from
studies reporting unadjusted data. Secondary analysis included
adjusted effect estimates from studies adjusting for confounding.

Of 3684 search results, 16 cohort studies encompassing 4173
bacteremias were included. Ten studies involved S. aureus, 5
enterococci, and 2 S. pneumoniae. One-third (33.7%) of the 3659
patients in the primary analysis received delayed appropriate
antibiotic therapy. The primary meta-analysis of 15 studies reporting
unadjusted data showed a statistically significant association between
delayed therapy and mortality (figure 1). Results from secondary
analysis using adjusted point estimates from 9 studies were similar
(figure 2).

association between delayed therapy and mortality

Delayed appropriate therapy was common and associated with increased
mortality in patients with gram-positive bacteremia. These findings
underscore the need for continued antimicrobial stewardship efforts to
ensure expeditious appropriate antibiotic therapy for patients with
gram-positive bacteremia.

AB  - ObjectiveTo determine whether changes have occurred at our center in
the incidence, patterns of organ dysfunctions, prognostic factors, and
case-fatality rate of bacteremic sepsis. DesignRetrospective
comparative study (1984–1988 vs. 1994–1997). SettingUniversity
hospital surgical intensive care unit. PatientsA total of 372
critically ill patients with sepsis and positive blood cultures.
InterventionNone. Measurements and Main ResultsIn the 1984–1988 study,
176 patients developed bacteremic sepsis (3.2 per 100 admissions),
with a fatality rate of 35% at 28 days, whereas in the 1994–1997
study, 196 patients had bacteremic sepsis (4.3 per 100 admissions),
with a 28-day fatality rate of 37%. The frequency of primary
bacteremia increased from 21% to 47% (p < .001), paralleled by an
increase in the proportional frequency of Gram-positive
microorganisms. In 1984–1988, 69% (n = 120) of patients had at least
one organ dysfunction, compared with 80% (n = 156) in 1994–1997 (p =
.02). The prevalence of pulmonary and cardiac dysfunction increased.
The case- fatality rate of septic shock remained high (69% vs. 68%).
For both cohorts, the two strongest predictors of mortality remained
the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score at the
onset of sepsis and the number of evolving organ dysfunctions.
ConclusionThe fatality rate of bacteremic sepsis remained constant
over the study period, despite an increased incidence of bacteremia
and associated organ dysfunction. Continued efforts need to be
directed toward the prevention of bacteremic sepsis, given the
magnitude and poor prognosis of this syndrome.

AB  - BACKGROUND

Infective endocarditis (IE) complicates up to a quarter of
Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia (SAB) cases. Risk scores predict IE
complicating SAB but have undergone limited external validation,
especially in community-acquired infections and those who use IV
drugs. Addition of the time to positive culture (TTP) may provide
incremental risk prognostication.

OBJECTIVES

To externally validate risk scores for predicting IE in SAB and assess
the incremental value of TTP.

METHODS

The modified Duke score was calculated for adults hospitalized with
SAB at a major tertiary institution. All patients underwent
echocardiography. Sensitivity and specificity of the risk scores for
predicting IE were calculated, and the incremental value of TTP was
assessed.

RESULTS

One hundred and six cases were analysed and 18 (17%) met definite IE
criteria. The optimal TTP to predict IE was 11.5 h (sensitivity 88.9%;
specificity 71.6%). The sensitivity of VIRSTA and PREDICT (Predicting
risk of endocarditis using a clinical tool) were similar (94.4% for
both) and higher than POSITIVE (Prediction Of Staphylococcus aureus
Infective endocarditis Time to positivity, IV drug use, Vascular
phenomena, pre-Existing heart condition; 77.8%). The receiver-operator
characteristic AUCs were VIRSTA 0.83, PREDICT 0.75, POSITIVE 0.89 and
TTP 0.85. Adding TTP to VIRSTA (i.e. VIRSTA+) resulted in the highest
AUC (0.90), sensitivity (100%) and negative predictive value (100%),
albeit with a low specificity (33%).

CONCLUSIONS

The VIRSTA and POSITIVE scores were the strongest predictors for IE
complicating SAB. The addition of TTP to VIRSTA (VIRSTA+)
significantly improved discriminatory value and may be safely used to
rationalize echocardiography strategies.

AB  - AbstractPersistent Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) that fails
to respond to appropriate antibiotic therapy is associated with poor
outcomes. Comprehensive prospective studies on risk factors and
outcomes of persistent bacteremia are limited. We investigated
outcomes and risk factors encompassing clinical, pharmacokinetic,
microbiologic, and genotypic characteristics associated with
persistent bacteremia using a case-control study nested in a
prospective cohort of patients with SAB at a tertiary-care hospital
from August 2008 through September 2010. We compared the clinical
characteristics, management, and outcomes of patients with persistent
bacteremia (≥7 d) with controls with resolving bacteremia (<3 d). To
detect associations between microbiologic and genotypic
characteristics of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates and
persistent bacteremia, we determined the heteroresistance phenotype,
SCCmec type, agr genotype and functionality, multilocus sequence
typing, and presence of 41 virulence genes. Our cohort consisted of
483 patients; 76 (15.7%) had persistent bacteremia, 212 (43.5%) had
resolving bacteremia. In the multivariate analysis, independent risk
factors associated with persistent bacteremia were community-onset
bacteremia (odds ratio [OR], 2.91; 95% confidence interval [CI],
1.24–6.87), bone and joint infection (OR, 5.26; 95% CI, 1.45–19.03),
central venous catheter-related infection (OR, 3.36; 95% CI,
1.47–7.65), metastatic infection (OR, 36.22; 95% CI, 12.71–103.23),
and methicillin resistance (OR, 16.99; 95% CI, 5.53–52.15). For
patients with eradicable foci, delay (>3 d) in the removal of the
infection focus was significantly associated with persistent
bacteremia (OR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.05–4.55). There were no significant
associations of persistent bacteremia with high vancomycin minimal
inhibitory concentration, vancomycin heteroresistance, and
microbiologic/genotypic characteristics of MRSA isolates. However,
initial vancomycin trough level <15 mg/L was an independent risk
factor for persistent MRSA bacteremia (OR, 4.25; 95% CI, 1.51–11.96)
in the multivariate analysis. Clinical outcomes were significantly
worse for patients with persistent bacteremia. Relapse of bacteremia
and attributable mortality within 12 weeks after SAB were
significantly higher in patients with persistent bacteremia than in
those with resolving bacteremia (9.2% [7/76] vs. 2.4% [5/212], p =
0.02 and 21.1% [16/76] vs. 9.4% [20/212], p = 0.009, respectively).In
conclusion, patients with SAB should be given early aggressive
treatment strategies, including early source control and maintenance
of a vancomycin trough level ≥15 mg/L, to reduce the risk of
persistent bacteremia.

AB  - Objectives:The contribution of individual immune response to
Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia on outcome has not been well studied.
The objective was to relate the host cytokine response to outcome of
Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. Design:Prospective observational
study. Setting:Three U.S. university-affiliated medical centers.
Patients:Adult patients infected with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia
hospitalized between July 2012 and August 2014. Interventions:Blood
specimens were obtained at Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia onset and
72 hours after therapy initiation. Levels of tissue necrosis factor,
interleukin-6, interleukin-8, interleukin-17A, and interleukin-10 were
measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at each time point and
compared between those with persistent bacteremia (≥ 4 d) and
resolving bacteremia. Primary outcome was persistent bacteremia after
4 days of effective therapy. Secondary outcomes were 30-day mortality
and 30-day recurrence. Measurements and Main Results:A total of 196
patients were included (mean age, 59 yr); of them, 33% had
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. Forty-seven
percent of the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains
were staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec IV. Persistent bacteremia
occurred in 24% of patients (47/196); they were more likely to die
than resolving bacteremia group (28% vs 5%; p < 0.001). Compared with
resolving bacteremia group, persistent bacteremia patients had higher
initial median levels of tissue necrosis factor (44.73 vs 21.68 pg/mL;
p < 0.001), interleukin-8 (124.76 vs 47.48 pg/mL; p = 0.028), and
interleukin-10 (104.31 vs 29.72 pg/mL; p < 0.001). Despite 72 hours of
treatment, levels remained higher for the persistent bacteremia group
than for the resolving bacteremia group (tissue necrosis factor: 26.95
vs 18.38 pg/mL, p = 0.02; interleukin-8: 70.75 vs 27.86 pg/mL, p =
0.002; interleukin-6: 67.50 vs 21.81 pg/mL, p = 0.005; and
interleukin-10: 30.98 vs 12.60 pg/mL, p < 0.001). Interleukin-17A
levels were similar between groups at both time points. After
controlling for confounding variables by multivariate analysis,
interleukin-10/tissue necrosis factor ratio at 72 hours most
significantly predicted persistence (odds ratio, 2.98; 95% CI,
1.39–6.39; p = 0.005) and mortality (odds ratio, 9.87; 95% CI,
2.64–36.91; p < 0.001) at values more than 1.00 and more than 2.56,
respectively. Conclusions:Sustained elevation of interleukin-10/tissue
necrosis factor ratio at 72 hours suggests a dysregulated immune
response and may be used to guide management to improve outcomes.

AB  - Background

Whether procalcitonin (PCT)-guided antibiotic management in patients
with positive blood cultures is safe remains understudied. We
performed a patient level meta-analysis to investigate effects of
PCT-guided antibiotic management in patients with bacteremia overall
and stratified based on type of pathogen.

Methods

We extracted and analysed individual data of 523 patients with
positive blood cultures included in 13 trials (7 studies evaluating
patients with acute respiratory illnesses, 6 studies patients with
sepsis), in which patients were randomly assigned to receive
antibiotics based on PCT levels (PCT group) or a control group. The
main efficacy endpoint was duration of antibiotic treatment. The main
safety endpoint was mortality within 30 days.

Results

Mean duration of antibiotic therapy for 253 patients who received PCT
guided treatment was significantly shorter compared to 270 control
patients (-2.86 days (95%CI -4.88 to -0.84, p=0.006). Mortality was
similar in both arms (16.6% vs 20.0%, p=0.263). In subgroup analyses
by type of pathogen, we noted a trend of shorter mean antibiotic
durations in the PCT arm for patients infected with gram positive
organisms or Escherichia coli and significantly shorter treatment for
subjects with pneumococcal bacteremia (-4.52 days [95%CI -7.40 to
-1.64, p=0.002). In analysis by site of infection, antibiotics
exposure was shortened in PCT group subjects with Streptococcus
pneumoniae respiratory infection and those with Escherichia coli
urogenital infections.

Conclusion

This meta-analysis of patients with bacteremia receiving PCT-guided
antibiotic management demonstrates lower antibiotic exposure without
an apparent increase in mortality. Few differences were demonstrated
in subgroup analysis stratified by type or site of infection but
notable for decreased exposure in patients with pneumococcal pneumonia
and E Coli urogenital infections.

AB  - OBJECTIVES

We examined factors associated with follow-up blood cultures (FUBCs)
in patients with monomicrobial Gram-negative (GN) bloodstream
infection (BSI) and investigated the impact of FUBCs on therapeutic
management and patient outcome.

METHODS

A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted of adult patients
diagnosed with GN-BSI at a tertiary-care university hospital during
2013-2016. FUBCs performed between 24 hours and 7 days after index BCs
was the exposure variable. Risk factors for 30-day mortality were
analysed by multivariate Cox analysis on the overall cohort, including
FUBCs as a time-varying covariate and on 1:1 matched patients
according to Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and time
to FUBC.

RESULTS

In 278 (17.6%) of 1576 patients, FUBCs were performed within a median
of 3 and 2 days after index BCs and active antibiotic therapy
initiation. Persistent BSI was found in 107 (38.5%) of 278 patients.
FUBCs were performed in more severely ill patients, with nonurinary
sources, difficult-to-treat pathogens and receipt of initial
inappropriate therapy. Source control and infectious disease
consultation rates were higher among patients with preceding FUBCs and
was associated with longer treatment duration. Thirty-day mortality
was 10.4%. Independent risk factors for mortality were Charlson
comorbidity index (hazard ratio (HR) 1.12) SOFA (HR 1.11), septic
shock (HR 2.64), urinary source (HR 0.60), central venous catheter
source (HR 2.30), complicated BSI (HR 2.10), carbapenem resistance (HR
2.34), active empiric therapy (HR 0.68), source control (HR 0.34) and
FUBCs (HR 0.48). Association between FUBCs and lower mortality was
confirmed in the 274 matched pairs.

CONCLUSIONS

FUBCs were performed in more severe GN-BSIs, yielding a high rate of
persistent BSI. In this context, FUBCs were associated with lower
mortality.

AB  - Abstract Background Bloodstream infections are associated with high
morbidity and mortality, both of which contribute substantially to
healthcare costs. The effects of early administration of appropriate
antimicrobials on the prognosis and timing of defervescence of
bacteremic patients remain under debate. Methods In a 6-year
retrospective, multicenter cohort, adults with community-onset
bacteremia at the emergency departments (EDs) were analyzed. The
period from ED arrival to appropriate antimicrobial administration and
that from appropriate antimicrobial administration to defervescence
was regarded as the time-to-appropriate antibiotic (TtAa) and
time-to-defervescence (TtD), respectively. The primary study outcome
was 30-day mortality after ED arrival. The effects of TtAa on 30-day
mortality and delayed defervescence were examined after adjustment for
independent predictors of mortality, which were recognized by a
multivariate regression analysis. Results Of the total 3194 patients,
a TtAa-related trend in the 30-day crude ( γ = 0.919, P = 0.01) and
sepsis-related ( γ = 0.909, P = 0.01) mortality rate was evidenced.
Each hour of TtAa delay was associated with an average increase in the
30-day crude mortality rate of 0.3% (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.003;
P &lt; 0.001) in the entire cohort and 0.4% (AOR, 1.004; P &lt; 0.001)
in critically ill patients, respectively, after adjustment of
independent predictors of 30-day crude mortality. Of 2469 febrile
patients, a TtAa-related trend in the TtD ( γ = 0.965, P = 0.002) was
exhibited. Each hour of TtAa delay was associated with an average 0.7%
increase (AOR, 1.007; P &lt; 0.001) in delayed defervescence (TtD of ≥
7 days) after adjustment of independent determinants of delayed
defervescence. Notably, the adverse impact of the inappropriateness of
empirical antimicrobial therapy (TtAa &gt; 24 h) on the TtD was noted,
regardless of bacteremia severity, bacteremia sources, or causative
microorganisms. Conclusions The delay in the TtAa was associated with
an increasing risk of delayed defervescence and 30-day mortality for
adults with community-onset bacteremia, especially for critically ill
patients. Thus, for severe bacteremia episodes, early administration
of appropriate empirical antimicrobials should be recommended.

AB  - Few studies analyzed the association between blood culture time to
positivity (TTP) and risk of complicated nontyphoidal Salmonella (NTS)
bacteremia. We conducted a retrospective study of 206 patients (aged
60.4 ± 17.4 years) with NTS bacteremia during a 30-month period.
Complicated NTS bacteremia was defined as the presence of 30-day
mortality, complicated infection requiring surgery or abscess
drainage, or requirement of intensive care unit admission. Serogroup D
(75.7%) was the predominant isolates. Malignancy (44.7%) was the most
prevalent comorbidity. Patients with rapid TTP (<10 h) were more
likely to have thrombocytopenia, septic shock, persistent bacteremia,
complicated infection, and a higher intensive care unit admission
rate. In multivariate logistic regression model, a TTP <10 h was an
independent predictor for complicated NTS bacteremia (adjusted odd
ratio, 5.683, 95% confidence interval, 2.396-13.482). Our study showed
that blood culture TTP provides important diagnostic and prognostic
information in the treatment of NTS bacteremia patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND

Staphylococcus aureus is a leading cause of bacteremia, yet there
remains a significant knowledge gap in the identification of relevant
biomarkers that predict clinical outcomes. Heterogeneity in the host
response to invasive S. aureus infection suggests that specific
biomarker signatures could be utilized to differentiate patients prone
to severe disease, thereby facilitating earlier implementation of more
aggressive therapies.

METHODS

To further elucidate the inflammatory correlates of poor clinical
outcomes in patients with S. aureus bacteremia, we evaluated the
association between a panel of blood proteins at initial presentation
of bacteremia and disease severity outcomes using 2 cohorts of
patients with S. aureus bacteremia (n = 32 and n = 124).

RESULTS

We identified 13 candidate proteins that were correlated with
mortality and persistent bacteremia. Prognostic modeling identified
interleukin (IL)-8 and CCL2 as the strongest individual predictors of
mortality, with the combination of these biomarkers classifying fatal
outcome with 89% sensitivity and 77% specificity (P < .0001). Baseline
IL-17A levels were elevated in patients with persistent bacteremia (P
< .0001), endovascular (P = .026) and metastatic tissue infections (P
= .012).

CONCLUSIONS

These results demonstrate the potential utility of selected biomarkers
to distinguish patients with the highest risk for treatment failure
and bacteremia-related complications, providing a valuable tool for
clinicians in the management of S. aureus bacteremia. Additionally,
these biomarkers could identify patients with the greatest potential
to benefit from novel therapies in clinical trials.

AB  - The timely and accurate identification of causative agents is crucial
for effectively managing fracture-related infections (FRIs). Among
various diagnostic methods, the “time to positivity” (TTP) of cultures
has emerged as a valuable predictive factor in infectious diseases.
While sonication of implants and inoculation of blood culture bottles
with sonication fluid have enhanced sensitivity, data on the TTP of
this microbiological technique remain limited. Therefore, patients
with ICM criteria for confirmed FRI treated at our institution between
March 2019 and March 2023 were retrospectively identified and their
microbiological records were analyzed. The primary outcome parameter
was TTP for different microorganism species cultured in a liquid
culture collected from patients with confirmed FRI. A total of 155
sonication fluid samples from 126 patients (average age 57.0 ± 17.4
years, 68.3% males) was analyzed. Positive bacterial detection was
observed in 78.7% (122/155) of the liquid culture pairs infused with
sonication fluid. Staphylococcus aureus was the most prevalent
organism (42.6%). Streptococcus species exhibited the fastest TTP
(median 11.9 h), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (median 12.1 h) and
Gram-negative bacteria (median 12.5 h), all of which had a 100%
detection rate within 48 h after inoculation. Since all Gram-negative
pathogens yielded positive culture results within 24 h, it could be
discussed if empirical antibiotic therapy could be de-escalated early
and limited towards the Gram-positive germ spectrum if no
Gram-negative pathogens are detected up to this time point in the
context of antibiotic stewardship.

AB  - Background: Time to Positivity (TTP) of blood cultures is defined as
the time elapsed between the start of incubation and the automated
alert signal indicating growth in the culture bottle. This study
evaluates the TTP of blood cultures in patients with Staphylococcus
aureus Bacteremia (SAB) and assesses the relationship between TTP and
mortality,

Methods: We performed a retrospective study involving adults who had
SAB between May 2007 and May 2010 in a tertiary hospital. TTP was
defined as the time between onset of incubation and growth detection
using an automated blood culture system.

Results: A total of 167 SAB were evaluated. Patient’s median age was
72 years (range, 18-95 years). The median TTP was 13.6 h (range,
3.6-95.2 h). Attributable mortality rate (27.5%) was not related to
the TTP (P=0.558) nor to the comorbidities. Age >60 years was the only
independent predictor of attributable mortality (P 11.3 h had a
negative predictive value of 96.4% for endocarditis. TTP was not
related to methicillin susceptibility nor resistance of Staphylococcus
aureus (P=0.934).

Conclusion: In our elderly population, shorter TTP was significantly
associated with a central source of infection and a persistent SAB. In
addition for the first time, community-acquired SAB was associated
with a shorter TTP. TTP  may contribute to a better management of SAB
by facilitating clinical decisions, especially in endocarditis

AB  - ABSTRACT Management of complicated bloodstream infections requires
more aggressive treatment than uncomplicated bloodstream infections.
We assessed the value of follow-up blood culture in bloodstream
infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus spp.,
Streptococcus spp., and Candida spp. and studied the value of
persistence of DNA in blood (using SeptiFast) for predicting
complicated bloodstream infections. Patients with bloodstream
infections caused by these microorganisms were enrolled prospectively.
After the first positive blood culture, samples were obtained every
third day to perform blood culture and SeptiFast analyses
simultaneously. Patients were followed to detect complicated
bloodstream infection. The study sample comprised 119 patients.
One-third of the patients developed complicated bloodstream
infections. The values of persistently positive tests to predict
complicated bloodstream infections were as follows: SeptiFast positive
samples (sensitivity, 56%; specificity, 79.5%; positive predictive
value, 54%; negative predictive value, 80.5%; accuracy, 72.3%) and
positive blood cultures (sensitivity, 30.5%; specificity, 92.8%;
positive predictive value, 64%; negative predictive value, 75.5%;
accuracy, 73.9%). Multivariate analysis showed that patients with a
positive SeptiFast result between days 3 and 7 had an almost
8-fold-higher risk of developing a complicated bloodstream infection.
In S. aureus, the combination of both techniques to exclude
endovascular complications was significantly better than the use of
blood culture alone. We obtained a score with variables selected by
the multivariate model. With a cutoff of 7, the negative predictive
value for complicated bloodstream infection was 96.6%. Patients with a
positive SeptiFast result between days 3 and 7 after a positive blood
culture have an almost 8-fold-higher risk of developing complicated
bloodstream infections. A score combining clinical data with the
SeptiFast result may improve the exclusion of complicated bloodstream
infections.

AB  - Background Appropriate empiric therapy, antibiotic therapy with in
vitro activity to the infecting organism given prior to confirmed
culture results, may improve Staphylococcus aureus outcomes. We aimed
to measure the clinical impact of appropriate empiric antibiotic
therapy on mortality, while statistically adjusting for comorbidities,
severity of illness and presence of virulence factors in the infecting
strain. Methodology We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adult
patients admitted to a tertiary-care facility from January 1, 2003 to
June 30, 2007, who had S. aureus bacteremia. Time to appropriate
therapy was measured from blood culture collection to the receipt of
antibiotics with in vitro activity to the infecting organism. Cox
proportional hazard models were used to measure the association
between receipt of appropriate empiric therapy and in-hospital
mortality, statistically adjusting for patient and pathogen
characteristics. Principal Findings Among 814 admissions, 537 (66%)
received appropriate empiric therapy. Those who received appropriate
empiric therapy had a higher hazard of 30-day in-hospital mortality
(Hazard Ratio (HR): 1.52; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.99, 2.34). A
longer time to appropriate therapy was protective against mortality
(HR: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.60, 1.03) except among the healthiest quartile of
patients (HR: 1.44; 95% CI: 0.66, 3.15). Conclusions/Significance
Appropriate empiric therapy was not associated with decreased
mortality in patients with S. aureus bacteremia except in the least
ill patients. Initial broad antibiotic selection may not be widely
beneficial.

AB  - Background. Severity of illness is an important confounder in outcome
studies involving infectious diseases. However, it is unclear whether
the time at which severity of illness is measured is important.
Methods. We performed a retrospective study of 328 episodes of
gram-negative bacteremia in adult patients to assess the impact of the
time of measurement of severity of illness on the association between
empirical antimicrobial therapy received and in-hospital mortality.
Using a modified Acute Physiology Score (APS), severity of illness was
measured at 2 time points: (1) hospital admission and (2) 24 hours
before the first culture-positive blood sample was collected.
Multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate the impact of
adjusting for the APS on the relationship between empirical therapy
received (ie, the exposure) and in-hospital mortality (ie, the
outcome). Results. The mean APS ( ± standard deviation) of patients
with bacteremia increased during their hospital stay (from 19.2 ± 11.6
at admission to 24.2 ± 13.6 at the second time point; P < .01). When
examining the association between empirical antimicrobial therapy
received and in-hospital mortality, and controlling for the APS, there
was a trend toward a decreased impact of appropriate therapy received
on in-hospital mortality. The unadjusted odds ratio (OR) for the
association between appropriate therapy received and in-hospital
mortality was 0.83 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.51-1.34). After
controlling for the APS at admission, this association was attenuated
(OR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.57-1.55]), and when a change in the APS was also
included in the multivariate logistic regression model, the
association was further attenuated (OR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.58-1.69]).
Conclusions. The magnitude of the association between appropriate
antimicrobial therapy received and in-hospital mortality among
patients with gram-negative bacteremia was sensitive to the timing of
adjustment for severity of illness.

AB  - PURPOSE

The purpose of the study was to investigate whether a novel assay of
antibiotic efficacy could predict clinical outcome measures in septic
patients in the intensive care unit (ICU).

METHODS

A prospective, noninterventional clinical study was performed
involving 48 adult patients with sepsis in a single adult general ICU,
with measurement of the time-to-positivity (Tpos) at 2 time points
(Tpos1, Tpos2).

RESULTS

The mean length of stay for all patients was 14.1 days (range, 2-98;
median, 10 days). There was no significant difference between the
Tpos1-adequate and the Tpos1-inadequate patients in day 1 Sequential
Organ Failure Assessment or Acute Physiology and Chronic Health
Evaluation II scores. However, there were a significant difference for
the length of stay in ICU, with median stay in the Tpos1-adequate
group of 7.8 days compared with 14.4 days in the Tpos1-inadequate
group (Mann-Whitney U test, P = .028), and a significant difference in
the length of stay in hospital, with a median stay in the
Tpos1-adequate group of 13 days compared with 31 days in the
Tpos1-inadequate group (P = .001). There was no statistical
association between Tpos1 and 28-day survival (P > .05). The Tpos2
data added no further information.

CONCLUSIONS

This pilot study provides preliminary evidence that measurement of
Tpos1 24 hours after the initiation of antibiotic therapy is
associated with ICU length of stay and might be of value as a
surrogate marker of antibiotic activity.

trials including 3729 patients, 7 days of antibiotics had a 97.8%
probability of being noninferior to 14 days for the outcome of 90-day

AB  - Abstract Background: Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) are the
most common contaminants of blood cultures, however, we sometimes have
difficulties in determining their clinical significance. It is still
controversial that there is a significant difference between the
contamination group and the true bacteraemia group in the time to
positivity (TTP) of blood cultures. We validated the relationship
between a TTP and the presence of CoNS bacteraemia in cancer patients
by using an objective, non-judgmental definition for CoNS
contamination. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 175 sets of blood
cultures drawn from 95 patients that yielded CoNS from October 2011 to
March 2013. We considered as contamination if an isolate of CoNS was
identified in one out of multiple sets of blood cultures. We
investigated the TTP, the threshold values and corresponding
likelihood ratios to distinguish CoNS bacteraemia from contamination.
Results: The median TTP in CoNS bacteraemia group was significantly
shorter than that in contamination group (14 h 45 min and 20 h 31 min,
respectively, p = .0157). A TTP of ≤16 h had a specificity of 83% for
predicting CoNS bacteraemia, and that of >20 h had a sensitivity of
86% for predicting CoNS contamination. Conclusions: We validated that
the median TTP in CoNS bacteraemia group was significantly shorter
than that in their contamination group, and that a TTP of ≤16 h was
associated with CoNS bacteraemia, while that of >20 h was associated
with CoNS contamination, if evaluated with an objective,
non-judgmental definition for CoNS contamination.

AB  - Background

Bloodstream infections remain a major cause of morbidity and
mortality. Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) bacteremia is typically
transient and usually resolves rapidly after the initiation of
appropriate antibiotic therapy and source control. The optimal
duration of treatment and utility of follow-up blood cultures (FUBC)
have not been studied in detail. Currently, the management of
gram-negative bacteremia is determined by clinical judgment. To
investigate the value of repeat blood cultures, we analyzed 500
episodes of bacteremia to determine frequency of FUBC and identify
risk factors for persistent bacteremia.

Methods

Of 500 episodes of bacteremia, we retrospectively analyzed 383 (77%)
that had at least 1 FUBC. We sought information regarding presumed
source of bacteremia, antibiotic status at the time of FUBC,
antibiotic susceptibility, presence of fever, comorbidities
(intravenous central lines, urinary catheters, diabetes mellitus,
AIDS, end-stage renal disease, and cirrhosis), need for intensive
care, and mortality.

Results

Antibiotic use did not affect the rate of positivity of FUBC, unless
bacteria were not sensitive to empiric antibiotic. Fever on the day of
FUBC was associated with higher rates of positive FUBC for
gram-positive cocci (GPC) but not GNB. Mortality and care in the
intensive care unit were not associated with positive FUBC. Seventeen
FUBC and 5 FUBC were drawn for GNB and GPC to yield 1 positive result.

Conclusions

FUBC added little value in the management of GNB bacteremia.
Unrestrained use of blood cultures has serious implications for
patients including increased healthcare costs, longer hospital stays,
unnecessary consultations, and inappropriate use of antibiotics.

AB  - The optimal duration of systemic antimicrobial treatment for
catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) is unknown. In this
systematic review, we aimed to assess the efficacy of short-course
treatment for CRBSI due to Gram-negative bacteria, coagulase-negative
staphylococci and enterococci. We systematically searched the
electronic bibliographic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane
Library for studies published before February 2021. All studies that
investigated the duration of adequate systemic antibiotic treatment in
adult patients with uncomplicated intravascular catheter infections
due to Gram-negative bacteria, coagulase-negative staphylococci or
enterococci were eligible for inclusion. Studies including concomitant
treatment with antibiotic lock therapy were excluded. The primary
outcomes were clinical failure/cure, mortality and
microbiologic-confirmed relapse. Seven retrospective cohort studies
and one case-cohort study met the inclusion criteria. No randomized
controlled studies met inclusion criteria. The quality of the included
studies was low (n = 7) to moderate (n = 1). No significant
differences were observed regarding mortality and microbiological
relapse between short-course and long-course systemic antibiotic
treatment in patients with CRBSI due to coagulase-negative
staphylococci or Gram-negative bacteria. No association was found
between mortality and treatment duration in the two studies assessing
enterococcal CRBSI. The limited data available suggests that shorter
systemic antibiotic treatment duration may be sufficient for
uncomplicated CRBSI. Further well-designed prospective studies are
needed to confirm these findings. CRD42021224946 (PROSPERO)

AB  - OBJECTIVES

The aim was the development of early clinical failure criteria (ECFC)
to predict unfavourable outcomes in patients with Gram-negative
bloodstream infections (GN-BSI).

METHODS

Adults with community-onset GN-BSI who survived hospitalization for
≥72 hr at Prisma Health-Midlands hospitals in Columbia, SC, USA from
January 1, 2010 to June 30, 2015 were identified. Multivariable
logistic regression was used to examine the association between
clinical variables between 72 and 96 hr after GN-BSI and unfavourable
outcomes (28-day mortality or hospital length of stay >14 days from
GN-BSI onset).

RESULTS

Among 766 patients, 225 (29%) had unfavourable outcomes. After
adjustments for Charlson Comorbidity Index and appropriateness of
empirical antimicrobial therapy in multivariable model, predictors of
unfavourable outcomes included systolic blood pressure <100 mmHg or
vasopressor use (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.8, 95% confidence
interval (CI) 1.2-2.9), heart rate >100 beats/minute (aOR 1.7, 95% CI
1.1-2.5), respiratory rate ≥22 breaths/minute or mechanical
ventilation (aOR 2.1, 95% CI 1.4-3.3), altered mental status (aOR 4.5,
95% CI 2.8-7.1), and white blood cell count >12 000/mm

CONCLUSIONS

Risk of 28-day mortality or prolonged hospitalization can be estimated
between 72 and 96 hr after GN-BSI using ECFC. These criteria may have
clinical utility in management of GN-BSI and may improve methodology
of future investigations assessing response to antimicrobial therapy
based on a standard evidence-based definition of early clinical
failure.

AB  - PURPOSE

The validation in critical patients with short-term catheters of a
method for diagnosing catheter-related bloodstream infection (CR-BSI),
based on the differential time to positivity (DTP) of blood cultures.

METHODS

Patients suspected of having CR-BSI were included. Two peripheral vein
blood cultures and a catheter hub blood culture were simultaneously
carried out. The responsible catheter was removed and tip cultured.
Times to positivity of all blood cultures were automatically
registered. CR-BSI was diagnosed when all the cultures were positive
for the same microorganism and DTP≥120 min. This diagnosis was
compared with the one obtained using the standard method.

RESULTS

226 cases suspected of CR-BSI were analyzed during a 20-month period.
A total of 19 removed catheters were associated with CR-BSI. Seven
cases of polymicrobial cultures (4 with CR-BSI) were discarded from
the final analysis due to the impossibility of determining the time to
positivity for each individual microorganism. Using the DTP method, 12
out of 15 CR-BSI cases were diagnosed (sensitivity 80%, specificity
99%, PPV 92%, NPV 98%). In a ROC curve, we found a cut-off value of
17.7 h in positivity of hub blood cultures that may be useful for
diagnosing CR-BSI.

CONCLUSION

DTP can be a valid method for CR-BSI diagnosis in critically ill
patients, avoiding unnecessary catheter withdrawal.

AB  - ABSTRACT In patients with Escherichia coli bacteremia, data on the
relationship of phylogenetic background, biofilm production, and
degree of bacteremia with clinical variables and prognosis are scarce.
During a 1-year period, all adults with bacteremia due to Escherichia
coli diagnosed at a university center were enrolled. Determination of
phylogenetic background, biofilm production, and genotyping was
performed with all strains, and the time to positivity of blood
culture vials was recorded. A total of 185 episodes of diverse-source
E. coli bacteremia was analyzed. Strains of phylogroup D were
predominant (52%). Phylogroup A isolates were associated with
pneumonia and prior antibiotic intake, B1 with an abdominal source of
infection, B2 with the absence of urological abnormalities, and D with
urological abnormalities and age below 65 years. Resistance to
antibiotics and no biofilm production were concentrated in phylogroup
A strains. Biofilm production was not associated with any clinical
variable. An immunocompromising condition (odds ratio [OR] = 5.01, 95%
confidence interval [CI] = 1.4 to 17.9), peritonitis (OR = 17, 95% CI
= 3.32 to 87), pneumonia (OR = 9.97, 95% CI = 1.96 to 50.6), and ≤7 h
to bacteremia detection (OR = 4.37, 95% CI = 1.38 to 13.8) were the
best predictors of a fatal outcome. Results from this study suggest
that the distribution of phylogenetic backgrounds among E. coli
strains involved in diverse-source bacteremia may be subject to
geographical variation and that, in afflicted individuals, some
high-risk sources, the patient's underlying condition, and the degree
of bacteremia are more important than microbial factors in determining
the outcome. Time to positivity of blood culture vials may be a
variable of potential clinical impact.

AB  - Abstract Background Timely antimicrobial treatment and source control
are strongly recommended by sepsis guidelines, however, their impact
on clinical outcomes is uncertain. Methods We performed a planned
secondary analysis of a cluster-randomized trial conducted from July
2011 to May 2015 including forty German hospitals. All adult patients
with sepsis treated in the participating ICUs were included. Primary
exposures were timing of antimicrobial therapy and delay of surgical
source control during the first 48 h after sepsis onset. Primary
endpoint was 28-day mortality. Mixed models were used to investigate
the effects of timing while adjusting for confounders. The linearity
of the effect was investigated by fractional polynomials and by
categorizing of timing. Results Analyses were based on 4792 patients
receiving antimicrobial treatment and 1595 patients undergoing
surgical source control. Fractional polynomial analysis identified a
linear effect of timing of antimicrobials on 28-day mortality, which
increased by 0.42% per hour delay (OR with 95% CI 1.019 [1.01, 1.028],
p ≤ 0.001). This effect was significant in patients with and without
shock (OR = 1.018 [1.008, 1.029] and 1.026 [1.01, 1.043],
respectively). Using a categorized timing variable, there were no
significant differences comparing treatment within 1 h versus 1–3 h,
or 1 h versus 3–6 h. Delays of more than 6 h significantly increased
mortality (OR = 1.41 [1.17, 1.69]). Delay in antimicrobials also
increased risk of progression from severe sepsis to septic shock (OR
per hour: 1.051 [1.022, 1.081], p ≤ 0.001). Time to surgical source
control was significantly associated with decreased odds of successful
source control (OR = 0.982 [0.971, 0.994], p = 0.003) and increased
odds of death (OR = 1.011 [1.001, 1.021]; p = 0.03) in unadjusted
analysis, but not when adjusted for confounders (OR = 0.991 [0.978,
1.005] and OR = 1.008 [0.997, 1.02], respectively). Only, among
patients with septic shock delay of source control was significantly
related to risk-of death (adjusted OR = 1.013 [1.001, 1.026], p =
0.04). Conclusions Our findings suggest that management of sepsis is
time critical both for antimicrobial therapy and source control. Also
patients, who are not yet in septic shock, profit from early
anti-infective treatment since it can prevent further deterioration.

AB  - OBJECTIVES

Differential time to positivity of cultures of blood drawn
simultaneously from central venous catheter and peripheral sites is
widely used to diagnose catheter-related bloodstream infections
without removing the catheter. However, the accuracy of this technique
for some pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus, is debated in
routine practice.

METHODS

In a 320-bed reference cancer centre, the charts of patients with at
least one blood culture positive for S. aureus among paired blood
cultures drawn over a six-year period were studied retrospectively.
Microbiological data were extracted from the prospectively compiled
database of the microbiology unit. Data concerning the 149 patients
included were reviewed retrospectively by independent physicians
blinded to the absolute and differential times to positivity, in order
to establish or refute the diagnosis of catheter-related sepsis. Due
to missing data, 48 charts were excluded, so 101 cases were actually
analysed. The diagnosis was established in 62 cases, refuted in 15
cases and inconclusive in the remaining 24 cases.

RESULTS

For the 64 patients with both central and peripheral positive blood
cultures, the differential positivity time was significantly greater
for patients with catheter-related bloodstream infections due to
S. aureus (P<0.02). However, because of the high number of
false-negative cases, the classic cut-off limit of 120 min showed 100%
specificity but only 42% sensitivity for the diagnosis of
catheter-related bloodstream infection due to S. aureus.

CONCLUSIONS

These results strongly suggest that despite its high specificity, the
differential time to positivity may not be reliable to rule out
catheter-related bloodstream infection due to S. aureus.

AB  - OBJECTIVES

To describe the current epidemiology of bloodstream infection (BSI) in
patients with cirrhosis; and to analyse predictors of 30-day mortality
and risk factors for antibiotic resistance.

METHODS

Cirrhotic patients developing a BSI episode were prospectively
included at 19 centres in five countries from September 2014 to
December 2015. The discrimination of mortality risk scores for 30-day
mortality were compared by area under the receiver operator risk and
Cox regression models. Risk factors for multidrug-resistant organisms
(MDRO) were assessed with a logistic regression model.

RESULTS

We enrolled 312 patients. Gram-negative bacteria, Gram-positive
bacteria and Candida spp. were the cause of BSI episodes in 53%, 47%
and 7% of cases, respectively. The 30-day mortality rate was 25% and
was best predicted by the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA)
and Chronic Liver Failure-SOFA (CLIF-SOFA) score. In a Cox regression
model, delayed (>24 hours) antibiotic treatment (hazard ratio (HR)
7.58; 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.29-18.67; p < 0.001), inadequate
empirical therapy (HR 3.14; 95% CI 1.93-5.12; p < 0.001) and CLIF-SOFA
score (HR 1.35; 95% CI 1.28-1.43; p < 0.001) were independently
associated with 30-day mortality. Independent risk factors for MDRO
(31% of BSIs) were previous antimicrobial exposure (odds ratio (OR)
2.91; 95% CI 1.73-4.88; p < 0.001) and previous invasive procedures
(OR 2.51; 95% CI 1.48-4.24; p 0.001), whereas spontaneous bacterial
peritonitis as BSI source was associated with a lower odds of MDRO (OR
0.30; 95% CI 0.12-0.73; p 0.008).

CONCLUSIONS

MDRO account for nearly one-third of BSI in cirrhotic patients, often
resulting in delayed or inadequate empirical antimicrobial therapy and
increased mortality rates. Our data suggest that improved prevention
and treatment strategies for MDRO are urgently needed in the liver
cirrhosis patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVES

The relationship between the timing of antibiotics and mortality among
septic shock patients has not been examined among patients
specifically with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia.

DESIGN

Retrospective analysis of a Veterans Affairs S. aureus bacteremia
database.

SETTING

One-hundred twenty-two hospitals in the Veterans Affairs Health
System.

PATIENTS

Patients with septic shock and S. aureus bacteremia admitted directly
from the emergency department to the ICU from January 1, 2003, to
October 1, 2015, were evaluated.

INTERVENTIONS

Time to appropriate antibiotic administration and 30-day mortality.

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS

A total of 506 patients with S. aureus bacteremia and septic shock
were included in the analysis. Thirty-day mortality was 78.1% for the
entire cohort and was similar for those participants with
methicillin-resistant S. aureus and methicillin-sensitive S. aureus
bacteremia. Our multivariate analysis revealed that, as compared with
those who received appropriate antibiotics within 1 hour after
emergency department presentation, each additional hour that passed
before appropriate antibiotics were administered produced an odds
ratio of 1.11 (95% CI, 1.02-1.21) of mortality within 30 days. This
odds increase equates to an average adjusted mortality increase of
1.3% (95% CI, 0.4-2.2%) for every hour that passes before antibiotics
are administered.

CONCLUSIONS

The results of this study further support the importance of prompt
appropriate antibiotic administration for patients with septic shock.
Physicians should consider acting quickly to administer antibiotics
with S. aureus coverage to any patient suspected of having septic
shock.

AB  - Key Points Question Is the use of appropriate initial empirical
antimicrobial therapy associated with lower in-hospital mortality in
patients with bloodstream infections? Findings In this cross-sectional
study including 32 100 patients with bloodstream infections from 183
US hospitals, the crude proportions of appropriate empirical therapy
use were 94.4% for gram-negative rods, 97.0% for gram-positive cocci,
and 65.1% for Candida species, with lower proportions for resistant
pathogens. Receipt of appropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy was
associated with lower in-hospital mortality for patients infected with
gram-negative rods, gram-positive cocci, and Candida species. Meaning
This study suggests that use of appropriate initial empirical
antimicrobial therapy may have a role in inpatient hospital mortality.

AB  - Persistent Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB-P) is well known but
poorly delineated due to unclear definition. We retrospectively
studied 78 patients with SAB-P using a stringent definition
(bacteremia for ≥7 d), in a single teaching hospital, during 1 January
2002 to 30 June 2003 and 1 November 2005 to 31 December 2006 to
determine whether the frequency, risk factors and outcome changed over
time. SAB was encountered in 354 and 259 instances during the 2
periods, respectively. Patients’ characteristics changed with
increasing organ dysfunction score (2.9±1.7 vs 3.4±1.4; p <0.001),
patients with invasive devices (27.7% vs 41.3%; p=0.001), hemodialysis
dependence (19.2% vs 27.8%; p=0.04), MRSA (50.8% vs 64.5%; p=0.001),
and vancomycin treatment (57.9% vs 67.2%; p=0.02). SAB-P frequency
increased slightly (11.0% vs 15.1%). Risk (associated) factors for
SAB-P (identified by logistic regression) were metastatic infection
(OR=5.60; 95% CI 3.00 – 10.47), vancomycin treatment (OR=4.17; 95% CI
2.14 – 8.11), endovascular sources (OR=3.35; 95% CI 1.92 – 5.85) and
diabetes (OR=2.14; 95% CI 1.26 – 3.64). SAB- and SAB-P-associated
case-fatality did not change (23.2% vs 18.5% and 25.6 vs 30.8%,
respectively). All survivors ultimately achieved clearance. These
findings suggest that patients with SAB are changing over time.
Additionally, SAB-P frequency is higher than previously reported.
SAB-P rise is probably due to increasing SAB, MRSA, and patients at
risk for complications. Innovative approaches should target novel
treatment modalities and risk reduction.

AB  - The objective of this study was to characterize microbiological
factors independently associated with higher mortality rates following
nosocomial bloodstream infection. All patients admitted to the
University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics between 1 July 1989 and 30
June 1990 who developed a nosocomial bloodstream infection were
included. The crude in-house mortality for the 364 patients with
nosocomial bloodstream infections was 33%. These deaths accounted for
25% of all in-hospital deaths. Significant risk factors for death from
bloodstream infection included diagnoses of cancers and diseases of
the cardiovascular and respiratory systems (p < 0.01). Neither
previous surgery nor neutropenia was associated with higher mortality
rates. Whereas the crude mortality rates associated with gram-negative
(33%) and gram-positive (31%) bloodstream infections were similar,
that associated with fungemia was higher (54%, p < 0.02). The
mortality associated with secondary bloodstream infections (46%) was
higher than that associated with primary bloodstream infections (28%,
p < 0.001). Furthermore, polymicrobial infections had a worse
prognosis than infections from which a single pathogen was isolated (p
< 0.05). A multivariate, logistic regression model identified four
variables that independently predicted mortality (p = 0.025): age (OR
1.01 per year; CI95 1.00-1.02); cancer (OR 2.35, CI95 1.26-4.37) or
diseases of the cardiovascular or respiratory systems (OR 2.20, CI95
1.04-4.67); polymicrobial infection (OR 2.34; CI95 1.21-4.53); and
secondary bloodstream infection (OR 2.46; CI95 1.50-4.02). The last
variable was the strongest independent predictor. Our study
demonstrates the importance of microbiological factors in the outcome
of nosocomial bloodstream infections.

AB  - BACKGROUND

The optimal duration of antibiotic treatment for bloodstream
infections is unknown and understudied.

METHODS

A retrospective cohort study of critically ill patients with
bloodstream infections diagnosed in a tertiary care hospital between
March 1, 2010 and March 31, 2011 was undertaken. The impact of
patient, pathogen and infectious syndrome characteristics on selection
of shorter (≤10 days) or longer (>10 days) treatment duration, and on
the number of antibiotic-free days, was examined. The time profile of
clinical response was evaluated over the first 14 days of treatment.
Relapse, secondary infection and mortality rates were compared between
those receiving shorter or longer treatment.

RESULTS

Among 100 critically ill patients with bloodstream infection, the
median duration of antibiotic treatment was 11 days, but was highly
variable (interquartile range 4.5 to 17 days). Predictors of longer
treatment (fewer antibiotic-free days) included foci with established
requirements for prolonged treatment, underlying respiratory tract
focus, and infection with Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas
species. Predictors of shorter treatment (more antibiotic-free days)
included vascular catheter source and bacteremia with
coagulase-negative staphylococci. Temperature improvements plateaued
after the first week; white blood cell counts, multiple organ
dysfunction scores and vasopressor dependence continued to decline
into the second week. Among 72 patients who survived to 10 days,
clinical outcomes were similar between those receiving shorter and
longer treatment.

CONCLUSION

Antibiotic treatment durations for patients with bloodstream infection
are highly variable and often prolonged. A randomized trial is needed
to determine the duration of treatment that will maximize cure while
minimizing adverse consequences of antibiotics.

AB  - OBJECTIVE

To determine the effectiveness of antibiotic regimens and time to
antibiotics in septic patients admitted to an intensive care unit from
the emergency department.

METHODS

A retrospective case-control study of patients with sepsis syndromes
admitted from the emergency department between August 2010 and July
2011 was conducted. Standard demographic information, time frames for
written antibiotic orders and administration, and information
regarding site of culture, organisms identified, sensitivities, and
antibiotic effectiveness were documented.

RESULTS

Four hundred medical records were reviewed; 184 patients met the study
inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis. Simplified
Acute Physiology Scores II and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment
scores were 49 and 6, respectively, and overall in-hospital mortality
was 20.7%. Patients with positive blood cultures had higher Simplified
Acute Physiology Scores II scores (56.0 vs 46.0, P = .0125). Serum
lactate levels were also significantly higher in the in-hospital
mortality group (3.2 vs 2.1, P = .0068). Computerized physician order
entry dramatically decreased the median times to the last appropriate
antibiotic administration (3.183 hours vs 6.992 hours, P < .0001) but
did not alter mortality (20.6% vs 20.8%). Appropriateness of empiric
antibiotic regimens was similar between patients surviving and those
who died during their hospital stay (63.5% vs 68.8%, P = .58).

CONCLUSIONS

Median times to the first antibiotic administration and last needed
appropriate antibiotic administration were less than 3 and 5 hours,
respectively; these times were similar between patients who survived
and those who died during their hospital stay. Patients with a serum
lactate level higher than 2.5 mmol/L were associated with a 2.5-times
increased risk of mortality.

AB  - Background: Little published data are available on the epidemiology
and significance of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) in blood
culture isolates among critically ill adult patients. Objectives: To
describe the epidemiology and frequency of CoNS blood culture isolates
in critically ill adults, and investigate the association between time
to positivity (TTP) of blood cultures and number of culture-positive
bottles with organ dysfunction and mortality. Design, setting and
participants: A retrospective chart audit in the intensive care unit
of a tertiary hospital comprising all patients who had positive blood
cultures for CoNS in 2009. Main outcome measures: TTP, number of
culture-positive bottles, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA)
scores, resolution of fever and white cell response and inotrope
requirement, length of stay in ICU and mortality. Results: In 2009,
there were 1514 and 109 positive blood culture sets for the hospital
and ICU patients, respectively. Of these, 515 sets from patients
outside the ICU (34% of all hospital positive blood cultures) and 54
from the ICU (49.5% of all ICU positive blood cultures) were positive
for CoNS. Patients with TTP ≤24 hours had higher organ failure scores
by 0.9 (95% CI, 0–3.4; P = 0.052). There was a trend towards an
association between increased 28-day mortality and TTP ≤24 hours (7/22
v 3/32; P = 0.071). There was no significant correlation between
number of bottles positive for culture and mortality, length of stay,
SOFA score, resolution of fever, white cell response, and inotrope
requirement. Conclusions: Early TTP of blood cultures with CoNS may be
associated with poorer outcome and may be a marker of true infection.
Given the relatively high frequency of this microbiological problem,
larger prospective observational studies are required to more clearly
define the significance of a CoNS blood culture isolates in critically
ill adult patients.

AB  - Our goals were to study the effect of rapid microbial identification
(RMI) of positive blood culture on patient's outcome and to identify
specific microbiological characteristics related to clinical benefit
of RMI. This was a retrospective-cohort study of hospitalized, adult
patients with bacteremia. The outcome of patients with bacteremia
episodes was compared before vs. after the initiation of RMI. RMI was
done by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight
testing of microcolonies. The study included 1460 and 2710 cases in
the pre- and post-intervention periods, respectively. There were
similar rates of gram-negative, gram-positive, anaerobes, and
polymicrobial infections, but higher rate of contaminants in the
intervention period (39.9 vs. 43.7%, p = 0.019). The median
time-to-identification decreased from 47.5 to 21.3 h (p < 0.001).
Post-intervention, the median LOS declined from 10.83 to 9.79 days
(p = 0.016), the rate of ICU transfer declined from 13.8 to 11.6%
(p = 0.054), and the mortality rate declined from 20.9 to 18.3%
(p = 0.047). The improvement in outcome variables remained
statistically significant in multivariate analysis when performed for
all episodes and non-contaminants but not for contaminants. The
mortality declined in gram-negative bacteremia (20% vs. 15.5%,
p = 0.005 in multivariate analysis) but not in gram-positive
bacteremia (18.1% vs. 18.5%). RMI reduces mortality from gram-negative
but not gram-positive bacteremia.

AB  - Background. The optimal duration of bloodstream infections due to gram
negative bacteremia has been poorly defined. The objective of this
study was to determine if short courses of antimicrobial therapy were
non-inferior to intermediate and long courses of antimicrobial therapy
for gram negative bacteremia. Methods. A retrospective, single-center,
chart-review was performed on patients with a documented gram negative
bacteremia from August 2006 to November 2013. Patients meeting
eligibility criteria were placed in the short-course,
intermediatecourse, and long-course treatment groups if their duration
of antimicrobial therapy was less than or equal to 7 days, between 8
to 14 days, or greater than 14 days, respectively. Data collected
included age, gender, source of bacteremia, infecting organism,
duration of therapy, and time to defervesence. The primary outcome was
the achievement of a clinical response at the end of therapy.
Secondary outcomes included achievement of microbiological cure at the
end of therapy, and association of clinical response in each group
with the causative organism, source of bacteremia, and time to
defervesence. Results. Of 368 cases of gram-negative bacteremia, 178
cases met eligibility criteria. Median age was 64 years with 67%
females. Median SAPS II (Simplified Acute Physiology Score) was 33
points. The most common infecting pathogen was Escherichia coli (46%),
followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (22%). The most common source of
bacteremia was the urinary tract (53%), followed by indwelling
catheters (14%). Clinical response rates at the end of therapy were
78.6%, 89.0%, and 80.6% for the short-course, intermediate-course, and
long-course treatment groups, respectively (P = 0.202).
Microbiological cure rates at the end of therapy were 83.3%, 89.0%,
and 91.7% for the short-course, intermediate-course, and longcourse
treatment groups, respectively (P = 0.690). Logistic regression
analysis did not reveal any association of clinical response in each
group with infecting organism (P = 0.350), source of bacteremia (P =
0.502), or time to defervesence (P = 0.561). Conclusion. Short-course
therapy for gram-negative bacteremia appears to achieve similar
clinical response rates and microbiological cure rates compared with
intermediateand long-course therapy. Disclosures. All authors: No

AB  - Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) are the most common bacteria
isolated from blood cultures, but a great proportion of them are most
likely contaminants.1,2 On the other hand, one single positive blood
culture for Staphylococcus aureus is usually sufficient to diagnose
bacteraemia. Therefore, a rapid method of differentiating CoNS from S
aureus would assist in the clinical decision on starting antimicrobial
treatment in a timely manner. As many laboratories routinely process
blood culture bottles in automated systems that record time to
positivity (TTP) and this information is readily available along with
the Gram-smear results, we assessed the predictive value of TTP for
the exclusion of S aureus in the setting of a positive result for
clustered Gram-positive cocci.1,3,4

For this purpose, we retrospectively analysed all blood cultures

AB  - PURPOSE

The impact of an antimicrobial stewardship initiative on time to first
antibiotic dose and clinical outcomes in bacteremic patients was
evaluated.

METHODS

A single-center, retrospective study was conducted for adult
inpatients who received antibiotics before and after implementation of
a rapid administration of antimicrobials by an infectious diseases
specialist (RAIDS) protocol. Patients admitted to an inpatient service
from June to October 2011 (pre-RAIDS protocol) and from December 2011
to February 2012 (post-RAIDS protocol) were eligible for inclusion if
(1) they were age 18 years or older, (2) their infection occurred two
or more days after hospital admission, and (3) they had a blood
culture growing an organism other than common skin contaminants (i.e.,
coagulase-negative staphylococci, Bacillus species). The primary
outcome was the time to the first antibiotic dose (TFAD), defined as
the time that elapsed from a positive blood culture result to
administration of the first empirical antimicrobial dose.

RESULTS

A total of 111 bacteremic patients were included in the analysis.
Implementation of the RAIDS protocol led to significantly faster
antibiotic order entry, verification, and administration of empirical
antibiotics in patients with bacteremia. The median TFAD was
approximately 8 hours faster in the post-RAIDS group than in the
pre-RAIDS group (9:09 hr:min versus 1:23 hr:min, p < 0.001). Patients
in the post-RAIDS group had a significant reduction in
infection-related mortality (p = 0.047), though all-cause 30-day
mortality was similar.

CONCLUSION

Early notification of an infectious diseases pharmacist about positive
blood cultures using the RAIDS protocol led to increased
appropriateness of empirical drug selection and a dramatic reduction
in the administration of antibiotics and was associated with decreased
infection-related mortality.

AB  - TO THE EDITOR—We read with interest the article by Kalil et al [1]
published in the 15 January 2014 issue of Clinical Infectious
Diseases, and would like to comment on the issue of time to
appropriate antibiotics and also to share findings from a
complementary study completed at our center. We commend Kalil et al on
their robust study design and analysis, as well as their novel
conclusions. As part of an institutional quality assessment activity,
we retrospectively determined the timing of appropriate antibiotics
and associated factors in a cohort of 111 consecutive solid organ
transplant recipients with gram-negative bacteremia from March 2008 to
December 2013 at the University of Washington Medical Center.
Eighty-seven patients (78.4%) met sepsis criteria at the time of blood
culture was drawn, and 65 (58.6%) met criteria for severe sepsis. As
in the study by Kalil et al, we found a relatively high rate of
appropriate antibiotics within 24 hours of blood cultures being drawn
(78.4%) and a similarly low 28-day mortality rate of 9.1% (Table 1).
Our study was not powered to determine if the time to appropriate
antibiotics was associated with mortality in this cohort. Because
multiple prior studies of patients with sepsis have demonstrated an
association between shorter time to appropriate antibiotics and lower
mortality [2–5], we are interested to know whether the authors are
able to assess this parameter in their models. As many large
transplant centers have institutional clinical pathways and guidelines
for management of sepsis in transplant patients, and because there is
often a heightened index of suspicion for infection in
immunocompromised patients, we wonder whether the lower mortality in
solid organ transplant patients reported by Kalil et al could, in
part, be explained by a shorter time to initiation of appropriate
antibiotics.

AB  - Objective

In patients receiving inappropriate empirical antimicrobial agents,
delaying of time to report positive hemoculture (TRH) may cause delay
switching from inappropriate antimicrobial agents to appropriate
antimicrobial agents, and thus may increase mortality. We hypothesized
that the patients with septicemia from different types of pathogens
may have differ duration of TRH, and duration of TRH may had an impact
on hospital mortality.

Material and Method

We performed observational study on the patients who were reported to
have bacteremia or fungemia

and admitted to the surgical intensive care unit, Phramongkutklao
Hospital during a 2-year period. Type of pathogens grew in blood
cultures and the sensitivities to antimicrobial agents were collected
from blood culture reports. Patients were categorized into three
groups based on their blood culture reports which were gram-positive
(GP) bacteria, gram-negative (GN) bacteria, and fungus. Primary
outcome was duration of TRH and secondary outcome was hospital
mortality among the three groups of patients.

Results

There were 9, 32, and 7 patients for whom growth of GP bacteria
(18.8%), GN bacteria (66.7%), and fungus

(14.6%) were reported in their blood cultures respectively. Patients
with fungemia had the longest TRH (130 hours, interquartile range
(IQR) 100-137 hours), followed by patients with GN (64 hours, IQR
48-78 hours), and GP bacteremia (55 hours, IQR 42-71 hours) (p =
0.001). There was no difference in hospital mortality (GP 89%, GN 66%,
fungus 71%, p = 0.4). TRH was found significantly longer in survivors
(n = 14) (81 hours, IQR 56-105 hours) than non-survivors (n = 34) (64
hours, IQR 48-71 hours) (p = 0.035). In multivariate analysis, we
found that every 1-hr increasing of TRH was associated with lower risk
of hospital mortality with adjusted odd ratio of 0.95 (0.92-0.99, p =
0.01).

Conclusion

Patients with fungemia had significantly longer TRH than patients with
GP and GN bacteremia. TRH was found

significantly longer in patients with septicemia who survived than
non-survivors.

AB  - ABSTRACT Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a
common cause of bloodstream infection (BSI) and is often associated
with invasive infections and high rates of mortality. Vancomycin has
remained the mainstay of therapy for serious Gram-positive infections,
particularly MRSA BSI; however, therapeutic failures with vancomycin
have been increasingly reported. We conducted a comprehensive
evaluation of the factors (patient, strain, infection, and treatment)
involved in the etiology and management of MRSA BSI to create a risk
stratification tool for clinicians. This study included consecutive
patients with MRSA BSI treated with vancomycin over 2 years in an
inner-city hospital in Detroit, MI. Classification and regression tree
analysis (CART) was used to develop a risk prediction model that
characterized vancomycin-treated patients at high risk of clinical
failure. Of all factors, the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health
Evaluation II (APACHE-II) score, with a cutoff point of 14, was found
to be the strongest predictor of failure and was used to split the
population into two groups. Forty-seven percent of the population had
an APACHE-II score < 14, a value that was associated with low rates of
clinical failure (11%) and mortality (4%). Fifty-four percent of the
population had an APACHE-II score ≥ 14, which was associated with high
rates of clinical failure (35%) and mortality (23%). The risk
stratification model identified the interplay of three other
predictors of failure, including the vancomycin MIC as determined by
Vitek 2 analysis, the risk level of the source of BSI, and the USA300
strain type. This model can be a useful tool for clinicians to predict
the likelihood of success or failure in vancomycin-treated patients
with MRSA bloodstream infection.

AB  - Abstract Background Few mortality-scoring models are available for
solid tumor patients who are predisposed to develop Escherichia coli
–caused bloodstream infection (ECBSI). We aimed to develop a
mortality-scoring model by using information from blood culture time
to positivity (TTP) and other clinical variables. Methods A cohort of
solid tumor patients who were admitted to hospital with ECBSI and
received empirical antimicrobial therapy was enrolled. Survivors and
non-survivors were compared to identify the risk factors of
in-hospital mortality. Univariable and multivariable regression
analyses were adopted to identify the mortality-associated predictors.
Risk scores were assigned by weighting the regression coefficients
with corresponding natural logarithm of the odds ratio for each
predictor. Results Solid tumor patients with ECBSI were distributed in
the development and validation groups, respectively. Six
mortality-associated predictors were identified and included in the
scoring model: acute respiratory distress (ARDS), TTP ≤ 8 h,
inappropriate antibiotic therapy, blood transfusion, fever ≥ 39 °C,
and metastasis. Prognostic scores were categorized into three groups
that predicted mortality: low risk (&lt; 10% mortality, 0–1 points),
medium risk (10–20% mortality, 2 points), and high risk (&gt; 20%
mortality, ≥ 3 points). The TTP-incorporated scoring model showed
excellent discrimination and calibration for both groups, with AUC
being 0.833 vs 0.844, respectively, and no significant difference in
the Hosmer–Lemeshow test (6.709, P = 0.48) and the chi-square test
(6.993, P = 0.46). Youden index showed the best cutoff value of ≥ 3
with 76.11% sensitivity and 79.29% specificity. TTP-incorporated

was associated with improving capability in predicting ECBSI-related
mortality. It can be a practical tool for clinicians to identify and
manage bacteremic solid tumor patients with high risk of mortality.

AB  - Objectives The potential benefit from appropriate empirical
antimicrobial therapy in patients with favourable prognosis at initial
presentation with Gram-negative bloodstream infection (BSI) remains
unclear. This retrospective cohort study examined the impact of
inappropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy on hospital length of
stay (HLOS) following Gram-negative BSI after stratification by
predicted prognosis using the BSI mortality risk score (BSIMRS).
Methods Hospitalized adults with first episodes of Gram-negative BSI
from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2013 at Palmetto Health Hospitals
in Columbia, SC, USA were identified. Multivariate Cox proportional
hazards regression was used to examine the association between
inappropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy and HLOS overall and
within each predefined BSIMRS category (<5 and ≥5). Results Among 830
unique patients with Gram-negative BSI, 469 and 361 had BSIMRS <5 and
≥5, respectively. Overall, the median age was 65 years, 448 (54%) were
women, Escherichia coli (444; 53%) was the most common bloodstream
isolate and 444 (53%) had a urinary source of infection. After
adjustments in the multivariate model, BSIMRS (HR = 1.14 per point,
95% CI = 1.11–1.17, P < 0.001) and inappropriate empirical
antimicrobial therapy (HR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.07–1.91, P = 0.01) were
independently associated with increased risk of remaining hospitalized
following Gram-negative BSI. Median HLOS with appropriate and
inappropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy was 7 and 10 days,
respectively, in patients with BSIMRS <5 (P = 0.03) and 13 and 17
days, respectively, in those with BSIMRS ≥5 (P = 0.02). Conclusions
Inappropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy is associated with
prolonged HLOS following Gram-negative BSI in patients with both good
and guarded prognosis.

AB  - OBJECTIVES

Considering the difficulty of diagnosing catheter-related bloodstream
infection (CRBSI), Koo Foundation Sun Yat-Sen Cancer Center uses
differential time to positivity (DTP) as a hospital-wide approach to
improve the diagnosis of CRBSI in febrile patients with indwelling
central venous catheters (CVCs). This study describes the result of a
hospital-wide use of DTP in a real practice setting.

METHODS

During January 2003-August 2007, 142 positive paired blood cultures
from 125 patients without infection focus other than CVC were
included. These were evaluated by DTP and semi-quantitative catheter
culture (SQCC) to confirm the diagnosis of CRBSI, and were further
divided into two groups: confirmed (either by DTP or SQCC) and
non-confirmed CRBSI (neither DTP nor SQCC positive).

RESULTS

Fifty-nine point two percent (84/142) of episodes were confirmed as
CRBSI, of which DTP was positive in 83.3% (n=70). Non-confirmed CRBSI
was associated with hematologic malignancy, neutropenia status,
previous antibiotics exposure and a lower CVC removal rate.

CONCLUSIONS

A hospital-wide approach of DTP was practical and feasible in
improving the diagnosis of CRBSI in a real practice setting.

AB  - We examined whether the time to positivity (TTP) and growth and
detection plot graph (GDPG) created by the automated blood culture
system can be used to determine the bacterial load in bacteremic
patients and its potential association correlation with disease
severity. Known bacterial inocula were injected into the blood culture
bottles. The GDPGs for the specific inocula were downloaded and
plotted. A cohort of 30 consecutive clinical cultures positive for S.
aureus and E. coli was identified. Bacterial load was determined by
comparing the GDPG with the “standard” curves. Variables associated
with disease severity were compared across 3 bacterial load categories
(< 100, 100–1000, > 1000 CFU/mL). S. aureus growth was sensitive to
the blood volume obtained whereas E. coli growth was less so. A
12-hour delay in sample transfer to the microbiology laboratory
resulted in a decrease in TTP by 2–3 h. Mean TTP was 15 and 10 h for
S. aureus and E. coli, respectively, which correlates with > 1000
CFU/mL and 500–1000 CFU/ml. For S. aureus, patients with a bacterial
load > 100 CFU/mL had a higher mortality rate, (OR for death = 9.7,
95% CI 1.6–59, p = 0.01). Bacterial load > 1000 CFU/mL had an odds
ratio of 6.4 (95% CI1.2-35, p = 0.03) to predict an endovascular
source. For E. coli bacteremia, we did not find any correlations with
disease severity. GDPG retrieved from the automated blood culture
system can be used to estimate bacterial load. S.aureus bacterial
load, but not E.coli, was associated with clinical outcome.

AB  - Infective endocarditis (IE) can be difficult to diagnose due to
non-specific symptoms and the imperfect sensitivity of blood cultures
and echocardiography. The interval between blood culture collection
and the first detection of bacterial growth is known as
time-to-positivity (TTP) and is considered a proxy for bacterial load.
Several studies have demonstrated a shorter TTP in staphylococcal IE
compared to staphylococcal bacteraemia of other sources; however,
evidence in enterococcal IE is limited. We characterise the
relationship between blood culture TTP and a diagnosis of Enterococcus
faecalis IE, along with the impact of demographic and patient-specific
factors. Retrospective analysis was performed for patients with blood
cultures growing E. faecalis at a single centre from 2017 to 2021.
Exclusion criteria included polymicrobial growth, repeat/relapsed
episodes of enterococcal bacteraemia and receipt of pre-blood culture
antibiotics. TTP was compared between participants with and without a
definite diagnosis of IE per the 2023 Duke-International Society for
Cardiovascular Infectious Diseases criteria. Comparison was also made
between participants with and without a clinical diagnosis of IE.
After exclusions, 114 episodes of E. faecalis bacteraemia were
identified. Twenty-seven (24%) had a definite diagnosis of IE.
Nineteen of the 27 (70%) IE cases were left-sided, and three (11%)
were device-related. One case of prosthetic valve endocarditis was
included. Other infective sources included the urinary tract ​(37/114,
32%) or an unidentified source (34/114, 30%). Median TTP was shorter
in bacteraemia of other sources than in Duke definite IE (10.6 vs 11.3
h), but was not statistically significant (p=0.07). The area under the
receiver-operator characteristic curve for the ability of TTP to
diagnose IE was 0.62. Median TTP was shorter in the clinical IE group
than bacteraemia of other sources (10.0 vs 11.4 h); however, this
difference was not significant (p=0.34). E. faecalis IE was not
associated with a shorter TTP than bacteraemia of other sources in
this study. Higher-quality evidence is required to inform the utility
of TTP in this condition.

AB  - OBJECTIVES

To investigate whether positivity in one or both index sets of blood
cultures influences clinical determinants and mortality when
diagnosing bloodstream infections (BSI).

METHODS

Retrospective population-based surveillance of all mono-microbial BSI
was conducted among residents of the western interior of British
Columbia. Clinical details were obtained by chart review and all-cause
case-fatality was established at 30 days. Index cultures were defined
as the first two sets of cultures initially drawn to diagnose incident
BSI.

RESULTS

A total of 2500 incident BSI were identified of which 945 (37.8%) and
1555 (62.2%) were based on one and two positive index cultures,
respectively. There was an overall difference in the distribution of
pathogens, with both Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus
pneumoniae more likely to have two positive index cultures. Different
foci of infection were associated with one versus two positive index
cultures. Overall, 409 patients died within 30 days of index BSI for
an all-cause case-fatality of 16.4%; with no difference between two
positive (250/1555; 16.1%) and one positive (159/945; 16.8%; p 0.3)
index blood culture. The number of positive index blood cultures was
not associated with 30-day case-fatality after adjustment for
confounding variables using logistic regression analysis.

CONCLUSIONS

Although approximately one-third of BSI are diagnosed on the basis of
a single positive blood culture and are associated with different
clinical determinants, whether one or both index blood cultures are
positive is not associated with lethal outcome.

AB  - OBJECTIVES

To evaluate whether appropriate early empirical glycopeptide therapy
improves outcomes of patients with methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteraemia.

METHODS

We retrospectively collected the data for all adult patients with
confirmed MRSA bacteraemia diagnosed and treated at National Taiwan
University Hospital during the period 1 April 1997-31 March 2001, and
followed their survival up to three years. The main outcome measures
were MRSA-related death and all-cause mortality.

RESULTS

There were 77 MRSA-related deaths among 162 patients. There was no
statistically significant difference in MRSA-related deaths between
patients receiving glycopeptides before or within 48 h after blood
culture (n = 43) (55%, 18/33, non-septic shock group; 90%, 9/10,
septic shock group) or those whose glycopeptide therapy was begun more
than 48 h after blood culture (n = 119) (37%, 40/107, non-septic shock
group; 83%, 10/12, septic shock group) (P = 0.11 and 1.00,
respectively). The outcome measure of all-cause mortality from 30 days
to 3 years yields similar results. Multivariate logistic regression
analysis and Cox analysis showed that the length of delay (daily
increment) between blood culture sampling and start of glycopeptide
therapy did not have a statistically significant impact on
MRSA-related death or all-cause 30-day mortality after adjusting for
the effect of other variables [adjusted odds ratio 0.99, 95%
confidence interval (95% CI) 0.88-1.12; adjusted hazard ratio 0.87,
95% CI 0.74-1.02, respectively).

CONCLUSIONS

The hypothesis that earlier empirical use of glycopeptide therapy
reduces mortality in patients with hospital-acquired MRSA bacteraemia
was not supported.

AB  - Aims

The aim of this study was to assess the possible use of time to
positivity (TTP) of blood cultures (BCs) collected at the Emergency
Department (ED) to estimate the probability of pyogenic streptococci
versus other Gram positive cocci in pairs and chains, such as
Streptococcus pneumoniae, other viridans group streptococci or
enterococci.

Methods

All patients 18 years of age or older evaluated at the ED from whom
BCs were collected and were positive for Gram positive cocci in pairs
and chains at the microscopic examination, were included in the study.
The BCs included were collected by venipuncture, were mono-microbial
and were the first bottles that flagged positive in each set. Complete
blood count requested simultaneously with BCs along with medical
history taken by the ED physician were also evaluated.

Results

In our case series, all BCs positive for Gram positive cocci in pairs
or chains at microscopic examination with a TTP ≤6.3 hours were
consistent with a pyogenic streptococcus (100% specificity; 95% CI:
92.7-100). Consequently, a TTP ≤6.3 hours has a 100% positive
predictive value (95% CI: 30.9-100). Conversely, no pyogenic
streptococci were recovered from positive BCs with a TTP >12.6 hours.
Therefore, as screening test, it has 100% sensitivity (95% CI: 77-100)
and 100% negative predictive value (95% CI: 83.4-100). The binomial
logistic regression model showed how as TTP increases, in BCs positive
for Gram positive cocci in pairs and chains at the microscopic
examination, the probability of a positive result for pyogenic
streptococci decreases (odds ratio: 0.548; 95% confidence interval:
0.387-0.775; P=0.001).

Conclusions

The results of this study are an adjunctive tool to clinical aspects
and fast microbiology laboratory tests to help assessing the
likelihood of a positive blood culture for pyogenic streptococci.

AB  - PURPOSE

This retrospective cohort study derived a "quick" version of the Pitt
bacteremia score (qPitt) using binary variables in patients with
Gram-negative bloodstream infections (BSI). The qPitt discrimination
was then compared to quick sepsis-related organ failure assessment
(qSOFA) and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS).

METHODS

Hospitalized adults with Gram-negative BSI at Palmetto Health
hospitals in Columbia, SC, USA from 2010 to 2013 were identified.
Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression was used to determine
variables associated with 14-day mortality.

RESULTS

Among 832 patients with Gram-negative BSI, median age was 65 years and
449 (54%) were women. After adjustments for age and Charleston
comorbidity score, all five components of qPitt were independently
associated with mortality: temperature < 36 °C [hazard ratio (HR)
3.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.95-4.62], systolic blood
pressure < 90 mmHg or vasopressor use (HR 2.40, 95% CI 1.37-4.13),
respiratory rate ≥ 25/min or mechanical ventilation (HR 3.01, 95% CI
1.81-5.14), cardiac arrest (HR 5.35, 95% CI 2.81-9.43), and altered
mental status (HR 3.99, 95% CI 2.44-6.80). The qPitt had higher
discrimination to predict mortality [area under receiver operating
characteristic curve (AUROC) 0.85] than both qSOFA (AUROC 0.77,
p < 0.001) and SIRS (AUROC 0.63, p < 0.001). There was a significant
difference in mortality between appropriate and inappropriate
empirical antimicrobial therapy in patients with qPitt ≥ 2 (24% vs.
49%, p < 0.001), but not in those with qPitt < 2 (3% vs. 5%,
p = 0.36).

CONCLUSIONS

The qPitt had good discrimination in predicting mortality following
Gram-negative BSI and identifying opportunities for improved survival
with appropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy.

AB  - Across a variety of clinical syndromes, the presence of bacteraemia
has been associated with worse outcomes than those seen in patients
without bacteraemia. In some individuals, the bacteraemia persists
even in the presence of effective antibiotic therapy. A 1984 study
examined persistent bacteraemia and detected an association with
Gram-negative organisms and intra-abdominal pathology [[1]Weinstein
M.P. Reller L.B. Clinical importance of 'breakthrough' bacteremia.Am J
Med. 1984; 76: 175-180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google

had become the predominant cause of persistent bacteraemia, possibly
relating to increased use of intravascular devices as well as to
improved surgical and source control methods for intra-abdominal
infections [[2]López Dupla M. Martinez J.A. Vidal F. Almela M. López

controversy as to whether they are required for patients with
Gram-negative bacteraemia (GNB). Indeed, two previous studies have
suggested low yield for repeat blood cultures in GNB. In our

In contrast to earlier published research, we compared patients with
FUBCs to those without, as well as those with positive versus negative
FUBC results. We found no difference in mortality among those with and
without FUBCs collected. In the nested case–control analysis, GNB
(compared to Gram-positive bacteraemia) was associated with a

In the univariate analysis, the acquisition of FUBCs was associated
with lower mortality, an association that held across a variety of
propensity score-weighted Cox proportional hazards models. Using the
same definition for FUBCs, Giannella et al. saw more selective FUBC
utilization (17.6%) associated with an even higher yield (38.5%). In
the univariate analysis, the patients undergoing FUBCs had higher
clinical severity score and a trend towards higher mortality. However,
in the multivariate analysis, FUBC acquisition was associated with
lower mortality; this was also demonstrated when comparing patients
with FUBCs to patients without FUBCs matched on Sequential Organ
Failure Assessment score and time to FUBC acquisition. How can we
reconcile the differences between these two studies and the previous
literature? Regarding the association of FUBCs with mortality, it is
important to note that these are all observational (nonexperimental)
studies, so FUBCs were drawn at the discretion of the managing
physicians. Utilization rates ranged widely (Table 1). Van Walraven
and Wong [[9]Van Walraven C. Wong J. Independent influence of negative
blood cultures and bloodstream infections on in-hospital mortality.BMC
Infect Dis. 2014; 14: 36Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar]
have previously shown that a negative blood culture can be a marker of
mortality in hospitalized patients, suggesting that the decision to
draw blood cultures can be influenced by patients being 'sicker' than
their counterparts for whom blood cultures are not obtained. In the
SCRIBE study, there was no mortality difference associated with FUBC,
while a lower mortality was associated with FUBC use in Maskarinec et
al. [[7]Maskarinec S.A. Park L.P. Ruffin F. Turner N.A. Patel N.

In some institutions FUBCs may be routinely collected, even in
patients who are clinically improving, whereas in other institutions,
FUBCs may be reserved for patients with disease that is not clinically
responding to treatment. That is, the institutional 'culture' of
culture collection would certainly influence the yield of these
cultures and the association with mortality. The distribution of
patient characteristics, sources of bacteraemia and causative
pathogens, as well as the rate of detection of different pathogens in
the FUBC, differ across these study populations (Table 1), suggesting
differences among these cohorts and culture collection practices that
could affect the usefulness of repeat blood culture testing. We
suspect, though, that methodologic differences may also have
contributed to conflicting findings across the studies. The approach
to handling patients with early mortality differed between studies;
some differences could relate to immortal time bias. Differences in
FUBC timing definitions may also have played a prominent role in study
discrepancies. Three of the studies defined FUBCs as those collected
more than 24 hours after the collection of the samples which revealed
the index bacteraemia [6Canzoneri C.N. Akhavan B.J. Tosur Z. Andrade

repeat blood cultures (24–48 hours) after the index bacteraemia would
be expected to yield greater rates of positivity. However, it is less
clear how cultures obtained during that window could influence patient
management, given that the original blood culture positivity would
often not yet be available to clinicians when the FUBC sample was
drawn.Table 1Studies evaluating role of FUBC in patients w

AB  - OBJECTIVES

To evaluate the impact of time to results (TTR) on the outcome of
patients with carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales bloodstream
infections (CPE-BSI).

METHODS

Times-series study conducted from January 2014 to December 2021,
selecting patients with first CPE-BSI episodes. Periods of
intervention were defined according to implementation of diagnostic
bundle tests in the microbiology laboratory: pre-intervention (January
2014-December 2017) and post-intervention (January 2018-December
2021). TTR was defined as time elapsed from positivity time of the
blood culture bottles to physicians' notification of CPE-BSI episodes,
and was evaluated in patients who received inappropriate empirical and
switched to appropriate targeted treatment (switch group). Analysis of
a composite unfavourable outcome (mortality at Day 30 and/or
persistent and/or recurrent bacteraemia) was performed for the total
episodes and in the switch group.

RESULTS

One hundred and nine episodes were analysed: 66 pre-intervention and
43 post-intervention. Compared with pre-intervention, patients in the
post-intervention period were younger (68 versus 63 years, P = 0.04),
had INCREMENT score > 7 (31.8% versus 53.5%, P = 0.02) and
unfavourable outcome (37.9% versus 20.9%, P = 0.04). Proportion of
TTR > 30 h was more frequent pre-intervention than post-intervention
(61.7% versus 35.5%, P = 0.02). In multivariate analysis of the 109
episodes, source other than urinary or biliary (OR 2.76, 95% CI
1.11-6.86) was associated with unfavourable outcome, while targeted
appropriate treatment trended to being protective (OR 0.17, 95% CI
0.03-1.00). Considering the switch group (n = 78), source other than
urinary or biliary (OR 14.9, 95% CI 3.25-69.05) and TTR > 30 h (OR
4.72, 95% CI 1.29-17.22) were associated with unfavourable outcome.

CONCLUSIONS

Decreased TTR in the post-intervention period was associated with the
outcome in patients with CPE-BSI episodes.

AB  - Persistent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)
bacteremia (MRSAB) is associated with poor outcomes and serious
complications. The MRSA guidelines define treatment failure and
persistent bacteremia as lasting ≥7 days; however, this definition
requires reevaluation. Aggressively reducing the bacterial inoculum
promptly is critical because factors already in place before clinical
presentation are driving resistance to the few antibiotics that are
available to treat MRSAB. Alternative approaches to treat MRSAB should
be considered within 3-4 days of persistent MRSAB. With rapid
molecular diagnostics emerging in clinical microbiology laboratories
and biomarkers as a potential for early patient risk stratification, a
future shorter threshold may become possible.

AB  - BACKGROUND

Bloodstream infections (BSIs) secondary to intraabdominal infections
(IAIs) are common in the intensive care unit (ICU). The Surgical
Infection Society guidelines recommend treatment duration after
achieving source control in patients with secondary bacteremia;
however, literature supporting this recommendation is limited. The
purpose of this study was to compare outcomes in patients who received
shorter versus extended duration of antibiotics for bacteremia
secondary to IAI.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted in adult surgical ICU
patients (n = 42) with BSIs and source control procedure(s) for IAI.
The primary outcome was recurrent IAI. Secondary outcomes included
surgical site infections (SSIs), Clostridium difficile infections
(CDIs), secondary fungal infections, and in-hospital mortality.

RESULTS

Forty-two patients met inclusion criteria and were divided into groups
according to antimicrobial duration; 12 patients received <7 d, and 30
patients received >7 d of antibiotics. There were no differences in
baseline characteristics between the two cohorts except for the
presence of sepsis [4/12 (33.3%) versus 27/30 (90.0%); P = 0.001].
Thirty-one percent (13/42) of all organisms isolated from blood
cultures were gram-negative bacteria, 12/42 (28.6%) were MDROs, and
2/42 (4.8%) patients experienced a culture mismatch in which cultured
bacteria were not susceptible to empiric antibiotic therapy. Rates of
recurrent IAI were similar between the two cohorts [1/12 (8.3%) versus
4/30 (13.3%), P = 0.554].

CONCLUSIONS

Among surgical ICU patients with BSI secondary to IAI, cessation of
antibiotic therapy within 7 d of source control was not associated
with an increased incidence of recurrent IAI.

AB  - Background: For critically ill adults receiving empirical vancomycin,
the duration of negative cultures after which vancomycin may be
discontinued without risking subsequent growth of
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) remains unknown.
Objective: We hypothesized that if sputum cultures did not grow MRSA
or blood cultures did not grow Gram-positive cocci on Gram stain by 48
hours, those cultures would not subsequently demonstrate MRSA.
Methods: We conducted an ancillary analysis from patients enrolled in
the Isotonic Solutions and Major Adverse Renal Events Trial (SMART).
In this cohort of patients, we collected data on the time of either
MRSA identification in culture or Gram-positive cocci identification
on Gram stain and rate of vancomycin discontinuation. Results: Of the
15 802 patient admissions in the SMART study, 6553 (41.5%) received
empirical intravenous vancomycin. Respiratory sputum cultures
demonstrated MRSA during 178 patient admissions. Among respiratory
cultures that would ultimately grow MRSA, 85% were positive within 48
hours, and 97% were positive within 72 hours. Cultures demonstrated
MRSA bacteremia during 85 patient admissions. In 83 cases (97.6%) of
MRSA bacteremia, Gram-positive cocci were identified within 48 hours
after the culture was obtained. Conclusion and Relevance: This
analysis of a large cohort of critically ill adults receiving
empirical vancomycin found that Staphylococcus aureus was present in
all but 15% of cases of MRSA-positive respiratory cultures after 48
hours, whereas Gram-positive cocci were identified within 48 hours
during nearly all episodes of MRSA bacteremia. These findings may
inform the timing of discontinuation of empirical vancomycin among
critically ill adults.

AB  - PURPOSE

Even with rapid diagnostic technology to swiftly identify infectious
organisms, prompt response is needed to translate results into
appropriate actions. The purpose of this study was to determine if the
introduction of real-time pharmacist response to positive rapid
diagnostic test results would decrease time to antimicrobial therapy
for gram-positive bacteremia and candidemia in a community hospital
setting.

METHODS

A quasi-experimental study was conducted in 2 community hospitals. The
study comprised 2 cohorts of adult patients who tested positive for
gram-positive bacteremia involving Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus
faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, or Candida species. The
preintervention cohort consisted of patients admitted from November
2017 through May 2018. The intervention cohort consisted of patients
admitted from July 2018 through January 2019, after the intervention
went live. The primary outcomes were time to optimal antimicrobial
therapy and time to effective antimicrobial therapy.

RESULTS

A total of 140 patients were included in the preintervention group,
with 124 patients included in the intervention group. The mean (SD)
time to effective therapy decreased from 13.9 (21.6) hours in the
preintervention group to 8.6 (12.5) hours in the intervention group
(hazard ratio [HR], 1.15; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.89-1.48; P =
0.29). The mean (SD) time to optimal therapy significantly decreased
from 53.7 (57.7) hours in the preintervention group to 38.4 (31.5)
hours in the intervention group (HR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.33-2.26; P <
0.001).

CONCLUSION

The introduction of real-time pharmacist response to positive rapid
diagnostic test results led to a significant decrease in time to
optimal antimicrobial therapy but did not significantly affect time to
effective therapy. The results showed that the allocation of limited
resources of a community hospital to such a stewardship program is
justifiable.

AB  - When a Staphylococcus-like organism (SLO) is microscopically found in
Gram staining of blood culture (BC) specimen, it seems reasonable to
administrate a glycopeptide (GP) for empirical therapy. The paper
investigates the risk factors for 14-day mortality in patients with
methicillin-resistance Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (MRSAB) and
clarifies the impact of the timing for initiating GP therapy. A
retrospective study identifies patients with MRSAB (endocarditis was
excluded) between 2006 and 2009. Patients were categorized as
receiving GP at the interval before a preliminary BC report indicating
the growth of SLO and the onward 24 hours or receiving GP 24 h after a
preliminary BC report indicating the growth of SLO. Total 339 patients
were enrolled. There was no difference on the 14-day overall or
infection-related mortality rates at the time to administer GP.
Multivariate analysis disclosed pneumonia (OR = 4.47; of 95% CI; of
2.09–9.58; P < 0.01) and high APACHE II score (OR, 2.81, with 95% CI,
1.19–6.65; P = 0.02) were independent risk factors for
infection-related mortality. The mortality rate did not decrease
following administrating GP immediately after a preliminary BC
indicating SLO growth. An additional research for the optimal timing
for initiating GP treatment is warranted.

AB  - Invasive infections with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
(MRSA) have been associated with increased morbidity and mortality.
The aim of the present study was to identify independent predictors of
early mortality and treatment failure in patients with MRSA
bacteraemia. A total of 132 adult patients who developed MRSA
bacteraemia during hospitalization in the University Hospital of
Vienna between 2000 and 2011 were screened and 124 were included in a
retrospective cohort study. Patient demographics, source of
bacteraemia, antimicrobial treatment and microbiological
characteristics were evaluated. The 28-day crude mortality was 30.6%.
Predictors of early mortality identified in multivariate Cox
regression analysis included higher patient age (adjusted hazard ratio
(aHR) 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.06, p 0.006), pneumonia (aHR 3.86, 95% CI
1.83-8.12, p <0.001) and failure to use MRSA active treatment (aHR
8.77, 95% CI 3.50-21.93, p <0.001). Ninety-one (73.4%) patients
received glycopeptides as specific MRSA treatment. Of 63 patients
treated with vancomycin, only 14 (22.6%) patients had aimed trough
levels of 15-20 mg/L. Vancomycin MIC ≥2 mg/L was detected in 28.2% and
was associated with glycopeptide pretreatment (p 0.001). All MRSA
isolates were susceptible to linezolid and tigecycline. Persistent
bacteraemia ≥7 days was documented in 25 (20.2%) patients. Independent
determinants for microbiological eradication failure in patients with
MRSA bacteraemia included endocarditis (p <0.001) and vancomycin
trough levels (p 0.014), but not vancomycin MIC. Failure of clinical
and microbiological eradication of MRSA among patients with MRSA
bacteraemia was associated with clinical entity rather than with
bacterial traits. Pharmacokinetic parameters seem to be decisive on
microbiological and clinical success.

AB  - Background: Optimal treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus bacteremias (MRSABs) with vancomycin minimum inhibitory
concentrations (MICs) high within the susceptible range is of concern
due to the high rate of mortality and increased prevalence. Objective:
The purpose of this study is to evaluate vancomycin treatment failures
in patients with MRSAB stratified by vancomycin MIC. Methods: In this
retrospective chart review, patients ≥19 years of age with MRSAB
between July 2010 and December 2016 were included if they received
intravenous vancomycin for ≥72 hours. Vancomycin treatment failures
were compared between patients with vancomycin MICs of ≤1 mg/L and 2
mg/L. Vancomycin treatment failure was defined as microbiological
failure at 7 days. Inpatient mortality, 30-day readmission,
vancomycin-associated nephrotoxicity, and early bacteremia clearance
at 48 to 96 hours were assessed as secondary endpoints. Results:
Fifty-eight patients were included in the vancomycin MIC ≤1 mg/L group
and 22 patients in the vancomycin MIC 2 mg/L group. No significant
difference was found in vancomycin treatment failures at 7 days
between groups (88% vs 91%, respectively; P = .850). At 96 hours,
there was no significant difference in vancomycin treatment failures
between groups (72% vs 90%, respectively; P = .127). No significant
difference was found in mortality (P > .99) or 30-day readmission (P >
.99). Conclusions: In this study, vancomycin treatment failures were
not more prevalent in patients with vancomycin MIC of 2 mg/L at 7
days. Regardless of MIC, antibiotics should be switched to an
alternative agent at 7 days for persistent bacteremia.

AB  - Abstract Background Catheter-related septic thrombosis is suspected in
patients with persistent central line–associated bloodstream infection
(CLABSI) after 72 hours of appropriate antimicrobial therapy. The
clinical diagnosis and management of this entity can be challenging as
limited data are available. We retrospectively studied the clinical
characteristics of patients with Staphylococcus aureus
catheter-related septic thrombosis and the outcomes related to
different management strategies. Methods This retrospective study
included patients with CLABSI due to S. aureus who had concomitant
radiographic evidence of catheter site thrombosis treated at our
institution between the years 2005 and 2016. We collected data
pertaining to patients’ medical history, clinical presentation,
management, and outcome within 3 months of bacteremia onset. Results A
total of 128 patients were included. We found no significant
difference in overall outcome between patients who had deep vs
superficial thrombosis. Patients with superficial thrombosis were
found to have a higher rate of pulmonary complications (25% vs 6%; P =
.01) compared with those with deep thrombosis. Patients who received
less than 28 days of intravascular antibiotic therapy had higher
all-cause mortality (31 vs 5%; P = .001). A multivariate logistic
regression analysis identified 2 predictors of treatment failure: ICU
admission during their illness (odds ratio [OR], 2.74; 95% confidence
interval [CI], 1.08–6.99; P = .034) and not receiving anticoagulation
therapy (OR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.11–0.54; P < .001). Conclusions Our
findings suggest that the presence of S. aureus CLABSI in the setting
of catheter-related thrombosis may warrant prolonged intravascular
antimicrobial therapy and administration of anticoagulation therapy in
critically ill cancer patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Sepsis remains a leading and preventable cause of hospital
utilization and mortality in the United States. Despite updated
guidelines, the optimal definition of sepsis as well as optimal timing
of bundled treatment remain uncertain. Identifying patients with
infection who benefit from early treatment is a necessary step for
tailored interventions. In this study, we aimed to illustrate clinical
predictors of time-to-antibiotics among patients with severe bacterial
infection and model the effect of delay on risk-adjusted outcomes
across different sepsis definitions. DESIGN: A multicenter
retrospective observational study. SETTING: A seven-hospital network
including academic tertiary care center. PATIENTS: Eighteen thousand
three hundred fifteen patients admitted with severe bacterial illness
with or without sepsis by either acute organ dysfunction (AOD) or
systemic inflammatory response syndrome positivity. MEASUREMENTS AND
MAIN RESULTS: The primary exposure was time to antibiotics. We
identified patient predictors of time-to-antibiotics including
demographics, chronic diagnoses, vitals, and laboratory results and
determined the impact of delay on a composite of inhospital death or
length of stay over 10 days. Distribution of time-to-antibiotics was
similar across patients with and without sepsis. For all patients, a
J-curve relationship between time-to-antibiotics and outcomes was
observed, primarily driven by length of stay among patients without
AOD. Patient characteristics provided good to excellent prediction of
time-to-antibiotics irrespective of the presence of sepsis. Reduced
time-to-antibiotics was associated with improved outcomes for all time
points beyond 2.5 hours from presentation across sepsis definitions.
CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic timing is a function of patient factors
regardless of sepsis criteria. Similarly, we show that early
administration of antibiotics is associated with improved outcomes in
all patients with severe bacterial illness. Our findings suggest
identifying infection is a rate-limiting and actionable step that can
improve outcomes in septic and nonseptic patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND

Sepsis has been associated with high morbidity and mortality. The aims
were to determine predictors of mortality among patients with
bloodstream infections (BSIs) and to ascertain the role of quick
Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) in predicting poor
outcomes.

METHODS

All internal medicine patients with BSIs at the Hospital of Jura,
Switzerland during a three year period (July 2014 to June 2017) were
included.

RESULTS

Among 404 BSIs, Escherichia coli represented the most common species
isolated (156 episodes; 38.6%), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (68;
16.8%). The most common site of infection was urinary tract accounting
for 39.6% of BSIs (160 episodes). Thirty-day mortality was 18.1%.
Multivariate analysis revealed BSI due to staphylococci, malignancy
(haematologic or solid organ), qSOFA≥2 points, Pitt bacteraemia score
as independent predictors of mortality, while appropriate empiric
antibiotic therapy and administration of antibiotic therapy within
three hours from infection's recognition were identified as a
predictor of good prognosis. qSOFA showed the highest sensitivity
(87.7%), negative predictive value (96.6%) and accuracy (0.83) as
compared to other scores. Mortality among 141 septic patients was
45.4%. Malignancy (haematologic or solid organ), primary BSI, Pitt
bacteraemia score, were independently associated with mortality, while
appropriate empiric antibiotic therapy and administration of
antibiotic therapy within the first hour from infection's recognition
were associated with better prognosis.

CONCLUSION

qSOFA as compared to other severity scores showed an excellent
negative predictive value. Better prognosis was associated with
administration of appropriate empiric antibiotic therapy and its
timely initiation.

AB  - BACKGROUND

Bloodstream infections (BSIs) are common after hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation (HSCT) and are associated with increased long-term
morbidity and mortality. However, short-term outcomes related to BSI
in this population remain unknown. More specifically, it is unclear
whether choices related to empiric antimicrobials for potentially
infected patients are associated with patient outcomes.

RESEARCH QUESTION

Are potential delays in appropriate antibiotics associated with
hospital outcomes among HSCT recipients with BSI?

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS

We conducted a retrospective cohort study at a large comprehensive
inpatient academic cancer center between January 2014 and June 2017.
We identified all admissions for HSCT and prior recipients of HSCT. We
defined potential delay in appropriate antibiotics as > 24 h between
positive blood culture results and the initial dose of an
antimicrobial with activity against the pathogen.

RESULTS

We evaluated 2,751 hospital admissions from 1,086 patients. Of these
admissions, 395 (14.4%) involved one or more BSIs. Of these 395
hospitalizations, 44 (11.1%) involved potential delays in appropriate
antibiotics. The incidence of mortality was higher in BSI
hospitalizations than in those without BSI (23% vs 4.5%; P < .001). In
multivariable analysis, BSI was an independent predictor of mortality
(OR, 8.14; 95% CI, 5.06-13.1; P < .001). Mortality was higher for
admissions with potentially delayed appropriate antibiotics than for
those with appropriate antibiotics (48% vs 20%; P < .001). Potential
delay in antibiotics was also an independent predictor of mortality in
multivariable analysis (OR, 13.8; 95% CI, 5.27-35.9; P < .001).

INTERPRETATION

BSIs were common and independently associated with increased morbidity
and mortality. Delays in administration of appropriate antimicrobials
were identified as an important factor in hospital morbidity and
mortality. These findings may have important implications for our
current practice of empiric antibiotic treatment in HSCT patients.

AB  - Sepsis affects millions of people around the world each year, and
accounts for a significant number of deaths in hospital intensive care
units (ICU). Timely diagnosis is key to decreasing morbidity and
mortality. ABSTRACT Time to positivity (TTP) for blood culture bottles
incubated in the BacT/Alert Virtuo instrument was compared to the
BacT/Alert 3D. TTP was significantly shorter with the Virtuo (median
16.2 h) than 3D (median 21.1 h; P < 0.001). Switching from 3D to
Virtuo significantly improved TTP in this multicenter hospital setting
study. IMPORTANCE Sepsis affects millions of people around the world
each year, and accounts for a significant number of deaths in hospital
intensive care units (ICU). Timely diagnosis is key to decreasing
morbidity and mortality. One important element of sepsis diagnosis is
organism detection using blood cultures. In this study, we examined
the impact of implementing the BacT/Alert Virtuo automated blood
culture detection system on time to positivity in an ICU patient

patients with bacteraemic UTI, many factors should be considered. For
example, in a recent multicentre randomized controlled trial comparing
7 days to 14 days of treatment, shorter duration was associated with
higher treatment failure among male UTI patients [[4]van Nieuwkoop C.

the regimen used for definitive therapy (e.g. fluoroquinolones vs.
β-lactams, or intravenous vs. oral therapy) is another important
factor to consider when assessing treatment duration. In studies that
failed to find a benefit from longer treatment duration, a
fluoroquinolone was used for the short treatment course

AB  - Abstract Background The value of follow-up blood cultures (FUBCs) to
document clearance of bacteremia due to Gram-negative bacilli (GNB)
has not been well established. Although previous studies suggested
that the yield of FUBCs for GNB bacteremia is low, it remains to be
elucidated for whom FUBC may be beneficial and for whom it is
unnecessary. Methods A retrospective cohort study was performed at 4
acute care hospitals to identify risk factors for positive FUBCs with
GNB bacteremia and to better guide clinicians’ decisions as to which
patients may or may not benefit from FUBCs. Participants included
adult patients with GNB bacteremia who had FUBCs and were admitted
between January 2017 and December 2018. The primary outcomes were the
factors associated with positive FUBCs and the yield of FUBCs with and
without the factors. Results Of 306 patients with GNB bacteremia who
had FUBCs, 9.2% (95% confidence interval, 6.2%–13.0%) had the same GNB
in FUBCs. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, end-stage
renal disease on hemodialysis, intravascular device, and bacteremia
due to extended-spectrum β-lactamase or carbapenemase-producing
organism were identified as independent predictors of positive FUBCs
with GNB bacteremia. Approximately 7 FUBCs and 30 FUBCs were needed
for patients with ≥1 or no risk factors, respectively, to yield 1
positive result. SummaryThis multi-site retrospective cohort study
found that among patients with gram-negative bacilli (GNB) bacteremia,
having ESRD on hemodialysis, intravascular devices, or bacteremia due
to multi-drug resistant GNB were each independently associated with
having a positive follow-up blood culture. Conclusions Follow-up blood
culture may not be necessary for all patients with GNB bacteremia and
has the highest yield in patients with 1 or more risk factors.

AB  - OBJECTIVES

The potential benefit from appropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy
in patients with favourable prognosis at initial presentation with
Gram-negative bloodstream infection (BSI) remains unclear. This
retrospective cohort study examined the impact of inappropriate
empirical antimicrobial therapy on hospital length of stay (HLOS)
following Gram-negative BSI after stratification by predicted
prognosis using the BSI mortality risk score (BSIMRS).

METHODS

Hospitalized adults with first episodes of Gram-negative BSI from 1
January 2010 to 31 December 2013 at Palmetto Health Hospitals in
Columbia, SC, USA were identified. Multivariate Cox proportional
hazards regression was used to examine the association between
inappropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy and HLOS overall and
within each predefined BSIMRS category (<5 and ≥5).

RESULTS

Among 830 unique patients with Gram-negative BSI, 469 and 361 had
BSIMRS <5 and ≥5, respectively. Overall, the median age was 65 years,
448 (54%) were women, Escherichia coli (444; 53%) was the most common
bloodstream isolate and 444 (53%) had a urinary source of infection.
After adjustments in the multivariate model, BSIMRS (HR = 1.14 per
point, 95% CI = 1.11-1.17, P < 0.001) and inappropriate empirical
antimicrobial therapy (HR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.07-1.91, P = 0.01) were
independently associated with increased risk of remaining hospitalized
following Gram-negative BSI. Median HLOS with appropriate and
inappropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy was 7 and 10 days,
respectively, in patients with BSIMRS <5 (P = 0.03) and 13 and 17
days, respectively, in those with BSIMRS ≥5 (P = 0.02).

CONCLUSIONS

Inappropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy is associated with
prolonged HLOS following Gram-negative BSI in patients with both good
and guarded prognosis.

AB  - Objectives

To compare antibiotic optimization and outcomes of patients before
implementation of the Verigene Gram-Positive Blood Culture (Verigene
BC-GP) nucleic acid microarray assay to after implementation with
antimicrobial stewardship (AS) interventions and after discontinuation
of AS interventions.

Methods

A retrospective pre-post-post quasi-experimental study was conducted
to compare the three periods. AS interventions consisted of real-time
guidance to clinicians on antibiotic selection. The primary outcome
was median time from Gram stain to optimal therapy. Secondary outcomes
included median time to effective therapy, median duration of therapy
for contaminant organisms, median length of stay after blood cultures
were collected, and all-cause in-hospital mortality.

Results

Out of a total of 923 patients, 390 (125 baseline, 134 intervention,
131 post-intervention) who were not on optimal therapy at the time of
Gram stain or had contaminated blood cultures were assessed. Compared
with baseline, only the median time to optimal therapy for MSSA
bacteraemia was reduced in both the intervention and post-intervention
periods (17 versus 17 versus 50 h; P < 0.001), respectively. In an
analysis adjusted for baseline differences among the groups using
quantile regression models, use of the Verigene BC-GP assay in both
periods significantly reduced time to optimal therapy by 14-22 h in
patients who would achieve optimal therapy at ≥ 26 h without the
assay. There were no differences in in-hospital mortality or hospital
length of stay between study periods.

Conclusions

A real-time AS intervention implemented alongside introduction of the
Verigene BC-GP assay led to improvements in antibiotic therapy for
patients with bacteraemia due to Gram-positive cocci, even after the
AS intervention was discontinued.

AB  - Abstract Background Gram negative rod (GNR) bloodstream infections in
patients requiring ICU level of care are associated with high risk of
mortality. Very limited data is available on specific risk factors
that are associated with this high mortality. The purpose of this
study was to identify characteristics associated with mortality in ICU
patients who were diagnosed with GNR bacteremia. Methods This was an
IRB approved retrospective chart review that was conducted during
November 2019 to November 2021 at a three hospital health system in
NJ. Patients were included if they required ICU level of care, age ≥
18 years old and had documented gram negative bacteremia. Patients
were excluded if they had metastatic cancer, left against medical
advice, or the blood culture was determined to be a contaminant. The
primary endpoint of the study was to evaluate the association of
characteristics and risk factors with all-cause inpatient mortality
(ACIM) in patients with GNR bacteremia requiring ICU level of care.
Secondary endpoints included impact of time to appropriate therapy and
time to microbiologic cure on ACIM. Results There was a total of 79
patients who met inclusion criteria. The median age of patients was 69
years, 44% of the patients were female, and 81% of patients were in
septic shock upon presentation to the ICU. The most common source of
GNR bacteremia was urinary tract, followed by lower respiratory tract.
The most common causative organism of bacteremia was E.coli, causing
25% of the cases. When evaluating primary endpoint, higher CCI (OR =
1.79, 95% CI [1.09-2.94]), and Pitt Bacteremia (OR = 2.1, 95% CI
[1.32-3.35]) scores were independently associated with an increased
risk of mortality in patients with gram-negative bacteremia in the ICU
setting. Microbiologic cure was associated with a lower risk of
mortality (OR=0.02, 95% CI [0.002-0.2]). Longer time to appropriate
therapy and microbiologic cure were not associated with increased
ACIM. Results Enterobacterales Breakdown Conclusion Patients admitted
with GNR bacteremia requiring ICU level of care with higher CCI and
Pitt Bacteremia scores have higher likelihood of suffering from ACIM.
Microbiologic cure was independently associated with lower risk of
ACIM. In a subset of patients, longer time to appropriate therapy and
microbiologic cure was not associated with increased ACIM. Disclosures

AB  - Background: To develop a scoring model incorporating time to
positivity (TTP) into clinical variables for predicting the mortality
of tumor patients with Escherichia coli caused bloodstream infection
(ECBSI).Methods: A retrospective single center study enrolling
hospitalized cancer patients with ECBSI was conducted from 2013 to
2018. The patients were randomly divided into development and
validation groups. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression
analysis were used to identify risk factors for mortality. The scoring
model was developed and validated based on logistic regression
coefficients.Results: 315 and 194 patients with ECBSI were included in
development and validation groups, respectively. Six significant risk
factors for mortality were identified and included in the scoring
model: fever ≥ 39℃, inappropriate antibiotic therapy, metastasis,
acute respiratory distress (ARDS), blood transfusion, and TTP ≤ 8h.
Patients were classified into low-risk (<10% mortality), medium-risk
(10%-20% mortality) and high-risk (≥20% mortality) categories based on
the predicted mortality rates in each score. The predicted mortality
for the three categories was 4.38%, 15.39%, and 51.77%, respectively,
in the development group, and 3.72%, 13.88%, and 50.09%, respectively,
in the validation group. The model showed excellent discrimination and
calibration for both groups, with AUC curves being 0.858 versus 0.835,
respectively, and no significant difference in the Hosmer-Lemeshow
test (6.709, P=0.48) and the Chi-square test (6.993, P=0.46).
Sensitivity and negative predictive values (NPV) increased along with
the decrease of cut-off values.Conclusion: The developed TTP-combined
scoring model is feasible for clinicians to predict the mortality risk
of cancer patients with ECBSI.

AB  - OBJECTIVES

The goal of this study is to identify clinical variables associated
with bacteremia. Such data could provide a rational basis for blood
culture testing in emergency department (ED) patients with suspected
infection.

METHODS

This is a secondary analysis of a prospective cohort of ED patients
with suspected infection. Data collected included demographics, vital
signs, medical history, suspected source of infection, laboratory and
blood culture results and outcomes. Bacteremia was defined as a
positive blood culture by Centers for Disease Control criteria.
Clinical variables associated with bacteremia on univariate logistic
regression were entered into a multivariable model.

RESULTS

There were 5630 patients enrolled with an average age of 59.9 ± 19.9
years, and 54% were female. Blood cultures were obtained on 3310
(58.8%). There were 409 (12.4%) positive blood cultures, of which 68
(16.6%) were methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and
161 (39.4%) were Gram negatives. Ten covariates (respiratory failure,
vasopressor use, neutrophilia, bandemia, thrombocytopenia, indwelling
venous catheter, abnormal temperature, suspected line or urinary
infection, or endocarditis) were associated with all-cause bacteremia
in the final model (c-statistic area under the curve [AUC], 0.71).
Additional factors associated with MRSA bacteremia included end-stage
renal disease (odds ratio [OR], 3.9; 95% confidence interval [CI],
1.9-7.8) and diabetes (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.1-3.6) (AUC, 0.73). Factors
strongly associated with Gram-negative bacteremia included vasopressor
use in the ED (OR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.7-4.6), bandemia (OR, 3.5; 95% CI,
2.3-5.3), and suspected urinary infection (OR, 4.0; 95% CI, 2.8-5.8)
(AUC, 0.75).

CONCLUSIONS

This study identified several clinical factors associated with
bacteremia as well as MRSA and Gram-negative subtypes, but the
magnitude of their associations is limited. Combining these covariates
into a multivariable model moderately increases their predictive
value.

AB  - The clinical significance of and the risk factors for persistent
bacteremia were assessed in 299 episodes. Persistent bacteremia was
defined as at least two positive blood cultures obtained on different
calendar days during the same infectious episode. Short-term
bacteremia was defined as positive blood cultures solely on the first
day of the infectious episode. A total of 4,277 episodes of
bloodstream infections were detected, of which 299 episodes (7%) were
persistent bacteremia. The following were independent risk factors
were for persistent bacteremia: burns, presence of a central vascular
catheter, cirrhosis, infections caused by Salmonella spp.,
polymicrobial infections, and inappropriate empirical antibiotic
treatment. Irrespective of the source of infection, the presence of a
central vascular catheter was correlated with an increased risk for
persistent bacteremia. Mortality among patients with persistent
bacteremia was 50%, compared to 35% among patients with short-term
bacteremia. Because of the high mortality associated with persistent
bacteremia, a thorough search for the source of infection is essential
to ensure timely and appropriate therapy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE

To evaluate the clinical usefulness and safety of the
differential-time-to-positivity (DTP) method for managing the
suspicion of catheter-related bloodstream infection (CR-BSI) in
comparison with a standard method that includes catheter removal in
critically ill patients.

METHODS-DESIGN

A prospective randomized study was carried out.

SETTING

A 16-bed clinical-surgical ICU (July 2007-February 2009).

INTERVENTIONS

Patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups at the time
CR-BSI was suspected. In the standard group, a standard strategy
requiring catheter withdrawal was used to confirm or rule out CR-BSI.
In the DTP group, DTP without catheter withdrawal was used to confirm
or rule out CR-BSI.

MEASUREMENTS

clinical and microbiological data, CR-BSI rates, unnecessary catheter
removals, and complications due to new puncture or to delays in
catheter removal.

RESULTS

Twenty-six patients were analyzed in each group. In the standard
group, 6 of 37 suspected episodes of CR-BSI were confirmed and 5
colonizations were diagnosed. In the DTP group, 5 of 26 suspected
episodes of CR-BSI were confirmed and four colonizations were
diagnosed. In the standard group, all catheters (58/58, 100%) were
removed at the time CR-BSA was suspected, whereas in the DTP group,
only 13 catheters (13/41, 32%) were removed at diagnosis, and 10 due
to persistent septic signs (10/41, 24%). In cases of confirmed CR-BSI,
there were no differences between the two groups in the evolution of
inflammatory parameters during the 48hours following the suspicion of
CR-BSI.

CONCLUSIONS

In critically ill patients with suspected CR-BSI, the DTP method makes
it possible to keep the central venous catheter in place safely.

AB  - BACKGROUND

Timely selection of adequate empiric antibiotics has become
increasingly difficult due to rising resistance rates and the
competing desire to apply antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) principles.
Individualized clinical prediction models offer the promise of both
reducing broad-spectrum antibiotic use and preserving/improving
adequacy of treatment, but few have been validated in the clinical
setting.

METHODS

Multivariable models were used to predict the probability of
susceptibility for Gram-negative (GN) bacteria in blood-stream
infections (bacteremia) to ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime,
piperacillin-tazobactam and meropenem. The models were combined with
existing resistance prediction methods to generate optimized and
individualized suggestions for empiric therapy that were provided to
prescribers by an AMS pharmacist. De-escalation of empiric antibiotics
and adequacy of therapy were analyzed using a quasi-experimental
design comparing two 9-month periods (pre and post-intervention) at a
large academic tertiary care institution.

RESULTS

Episodes of bacteremia (n=182) were identified in the pre-intervention
and post-intervention (n=201) periods. Patients who received the
intervention were more likely to have their therapy de-escalated (29
vs 21%, aOR=1.77, 95%CI 1.09-2.87, p=0.02). The intervention also
increased the proportion of patients who were on the narrowest
adequate therapy at the time of culture finalization (44% in the
control group and 55% in the intervention group; aOR=2.04, 95%CI
1.27-3.27, p=0.003). Time to adequate therapy was similar in the
intervention and control groups (5 vs 4 hours; p=0.95).

CONCLUSIONS

An AMS intervention, based on individualized predictive models for
resistance, can influence empiric antibiotic selections for GN
bacteremia to facilitate early de-escalation of therapy without
compromising adequacy of antibiotic coverage.

AB  - Bacteremia is linked to substantial morbidity and medical costs.
However, the association between the timing of achieving hemodynamic
stability and clinical outcomes remains undetermined. Of the
multicenter cohort consisted of 888 adults with community-onset
bacteremia initially complicated with severe sepsis and septic shock
in the emergency department (ED), a positive linear-by-linear
association (γ = 0.839, p < 0.001) of the time-to-appropriate
antibiotic (TtAa) and the hypotension period after appropriate
antimicrobial therapy (AAT) was exhibited, and a positive trend of the
hypotension period after AAT administration in the 15-day (γ = 0.957,
p = 0.003) or 30-day crude (γ = 0.975, p = 0.001) mortality rate was
evidenced. Moreover, for every hour delay of the TtAa, 30-day survival
dropped an average of 0.8% (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.008; p <
0.001); and each additional hour of the hypotension period following
AAT initiation notably resulted in with an average 1.1% increase (AOR,
1.011; p < 0.001) in the 30-day crude mortality rate, after adjusting
all independent determinants of 30-day mortality recognized by the
multivariate regression model. Conclusively, for bacteremia patients
initially experiencing severe sepsis and septic shock, prompt AAT
administration might shorten the hypotension period to achieve
favourable prognoses.

AB  - Background Gram-negative bacterial bloodstream infection (BSI) is a
serious condition with estimated 30% mortality. Clinical outcomes for
patients with severe infections improve when antibiotics are
appropriately chosen and given early. The objective of this study was
to estimate the association of prior healthcare exposure on time to
appropriate antibiotic therapy in patients with gram-negative BSI.
Method We performed a multicenter cohort study of adult, hospitalized
patients with gram-negative BSI using time to event analysis in nine
community hospitals from 2003-2006. Event time was defined as the
first administration of an antibiotic with in vitro activity against
the infecting organism. Healthcare exposure status was categorized as
community-acquired, healthcare-associated, or hospital-acquired. Time
to appropriate therapy among groups of patients with differing
healthcare exposure status was assessed using Kaplan-Meier analyses
and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models. Results The cohort
included 578 patients with gram-negative BSI, including 320 (55%)
healthcare-associated, 217 (38%) community-acquired, and 41 (7%)
hospital-acquired infections. 529 (92%) patients received an
appropriate antibiotic during their hospitalization. Time to
appropriate therapy was significantly different among the groups of
healthcare exposure status (log-rank p=0.02). Time to first antibiotic
administration regardless of drug appropriateness was not different
between groups (p=0.3). The unadjusted hazard ratios (HR) (95%
confidence interval) were 0.80 (0.65-0.98) for healthcare-associated
and 0.72 (0.63-0.82) for hospital-acquired, relative to patients with
community-acquired BSI. In multivariable analysis, interaction was
found between the main effect and baseline Charlson comorbidity index.
When Charlson index was 3, adjusted HRs were 0.66 (0.48-0.92) for
healthcare-associated and 0.57 (0.44-0.75) for hospital-acquired,
relative to patients with community-acquired infections. Conclusions
Patients with healthcare-associated or hospital-acquired BSI
experienced delays in receipt of appropriate antibiotics for
gram-negative BSI compared to patients with community-acquired BSI.
This difference was not due to delayed initiation of antibiotic
therapy, but due to the inappropriate choice of antibiotic.

AB  - Abstract Objectives The risk factors and outcomes associated with
persistent bacteraemia in Gram-negative bloodstream infection (GN-BSI)
are not well described. We conducted a follow-on analysis of a
retrospective population-wide cohort to characterize persistent
bacteraemia in patients with GN-BSI. Methods We included all
hospitalized patients >18 years old with GN-BSI between April 2017 and
December 2021 in Ontario who received follow-up blood culture (FUBC)
2–5 days after the index positive blood culture. Persistent
bacteraemia was defined as having a positive FUBC with the same
Gram-negative organism as the index blood culture. We identified
variables independently associated with persistent bacteraemia in a
multivariable logistic regression model. We evaluated whether
persistent bacteraemia was associated with increased odds of 30- and
90-day all-cause mortality using multivariable logistic regression
models adjusted for potential confounders. Results In this study, 8807
patients were included; 600 (6.8%) had persistent bacteraemia. Having
a permanent catheter, antimicrobial resistance, nosocomial infection,
ICU admission, respiratory or skin and soft tissue source of
infection, and infection by a non-fermenter or
non-Enterobacterales/anaerobic organism were associated with increased
odds of having persistent bacteraemia. The 30-day mortality was 17.2%
versus 9.6% in those with and without persistent bacteraemia (aOR
1.65, 95% CI 1.29–2.11), while 90-day mortality was 25.5% versus
16.9%, respectively (aOR 1.53, 95% CI 1.24–1.89). Prevalence and odds
of developing persistent bacteraemia varied widely depending on
causative organism. Conclusions Persistent bacteraemia is uncommon in
GN-BSI but is associated with poorer outcomes. A validated risk
stratification tool may be useful to identify patients with persistent
bacteraemia.

AB  - OBJECTIVE

To determine the value of differential time to positivity (DTTP) of
blood culture for the diagnosis of catheter-related bloodstream
infection (CRBSI) in patients with solid tumors in intensive care unit
(ICU).

METHODS

A retrospective study was conducted. 615 pairs of peripheral vein
blood cultures and instantaneous catheter tip blood culture of 615
patients admitted to ICU of Tianjin Medical University Cancer
Institute and Hospital were collected from August 2011 to March 2014.
The DTTP method and (or) semi quantitative culture of catheter tip
were compared. CRBSI was diagnosed when both cultures were positive
for the same microorganism and DTTP≥2 hours (120 minutes). The result
of this procedure was compared with that of organism obtained using
the semi quantitative culture of blood at catheter tip with ≥15 cfu.
Based on the clinical diagnosis, the reliability of two kinds of
laboratory examination was compared for the diagnosis of CRBSI by
plotting receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC curve).

RESULTS

The result of 615 cases suspected of having CRBSI were analyzed during
the study period. Of these, 440 episodes were excluded because
cultures were negative for blood obtained through peripheral vein and
central vein. Eight episodes were excluded because only peripheral
vein blood culture was positive and 57 episodes were excluded because
of only central vein blood culture was positive, 68 pairs of blood
cultures were excluded due to the presence of multiple catheters and
repeated blood withdrawals. Two cases of polymicrobial cultures were
excluded from the final analysis due to the difficulty in determining
the time of positive result for each individual microorganism. Ten
cases in 42 cases of suspected cases of CRBSI were excluded from
analysis because catheter was not removed, therefore culture from
catheter tip could not be obtained. Using the DTTP method, 14 out of
17 CRBSI cases were diagnosed with DTTP≥120 minutes, while 3 cases
were missed; the semi quantitative catheter tip culture was positive
in 13 cases, and in 4 cases it was neglected. In 2 cases of CRBSI it
was missed by both methods. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of
DTTP, catheter tip culture and the combination method was 0.912, 0.882
and 0.941 for diagnosis of CRBSI, respectively. Validity values for
the diagnosis of CRBSI for DTTP were: sensitivity 82.35%, specificity
92.31%, positive predictive value 93.33% and negative predictive value
80.00%, and they were higher than those of the catheter tip culture
method only (76.47%, 84.62%, 86.67% and 73.33%). The specificity and
positive predictive CRBSI combination of the two methods in the
diagnosis value were up to 100%, the sensitivity (88.24%) and negative
predictive value (86.67%) was also increased, but no significant
differences were found with DTTP method (χ2=0.00, P=1.00; χ2=0.00,
P=0.98; χ2=0.00, P=0.98; χ2=0.00, P=0.98).

CONCLUSIONS

DTTP can be a valid method recommended for CRBSI diagnosis in
critically ill patients with acceptable sensitivity, good specificity
as well as positive predictive value. DTTP combined with other
clinical symptoms can not only avoid unnecessary catheter withdrawal,
but it also can help obtain the optimal treatment time and strategy.

AB  - BACKGROUND

Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) is associated with significant
morbidity and mortality in hospitalized adults.

OBJECTIVE

We aimed to identify current practice patterns in the management of
SAB, and to evaluate their association with clinical outcomes.

DESIGN

Retrospective cohort study.

SETTING

A 1558-bed tertiary care teaching hospital.

PATIENTS

Adult patients hospitalized between January 1, 2012 through April 30,
2013, who had at least 1 positive blood culture with S aureus.

INTERVENTION

None

MEASUREMENTS

Electronic medical records were reviewed and the processes of care in
the management of SAB were identified. The main outcome was clinical
failure, defined as a composite endpoint of in-hospital mortality and
persistent bacteremia.

RESULTS

Two hundred fifty episodes of SAB occurred in 241 patients, and 78
(32.4%) had clinical failure. Processes of care that impacted the risk
of clinical failure included: timing of follow-up blood cultures
(delays of >4 days had a relative risk [RR] of 6.6; 95% confidence
interval [CI]: 2.1-20.5; P = 0.001), consultation with infectious
diseases specialist within 6 days from diagnosis of SAB (RR: 0.3; 95%
CI: 0.1-0.9; P = 0.03), and use of β-lactams in patients with
methicillin-susceptible S aureus bacteremia (RR: 0.1; 95% CI:
0.04-0.5; P = 0.002).

CONCLUSIONS

The processes of care identified in our study could serve as quality
and patient safety indicators for the management of SAB.

AB  - Background: Blood infections are life-threatening if not detected and
managed properly. This study investigates the correlation between
fever and previous antibiotics therapy with differential time to
positivity (DTP) at admitted patients at Nemazee Hospital in Shiraz,
southern Iran. Methods: From January 2005 to December 2006, 985
positive blood samples in Bactec bottles from the admitted patients at
Nemazee Hospital were analyzed. Sensitivity patterns of the bacteria
to a panel of antibiotics were determined by the disk diffusion
method. Results: S. epidermidis, S. aureus and Acinetobacter were the
most prevalent isolates respectively. However, only 100 (20.7%) S.
epidermidis samples were the true infections. The most susceptible
Gram positive and negative bacteria were S. viridance, S. aureus , H.
influenzae , and Brucella spp., respectively. Imipenem, amikacin and
ciprofloxacin were the effective ones against Gram negative bacteria,
while vancomycin, co-amoxiclav and chloramphenicol were effective
against Gram positive ones. Cefuroxime and penicillin G were less
effective antibiotics against both Gram negative and positive
bacteria.

TI  - Antibiotic-resistant Bacteria in Hospitalized Patients with
Bloodstream infections: Analysis of Some Associated Factors
ER  - 
TY  - JOUR
AB  - Background: Bloodstream infections (BSIs), including persistent
bacteremia (PB), are a leading source of morbidity and mortality
globally. PB has a higher mortality rate than non- PB, but the
clinical aspects of PB in terms of the causative pathogens and the
presence of clearance of PB are not well elucidated. Therefore, this
study aimed to describe the clinical and epidemiological
characteristics of PB in a real-world clinical setting. Methods: We
performed a retrospective observational survey of patients who
underwent blood culture between January 2012 and December 2021 at
Tohoku University Hospital. Cases of PB were divided into three groups
depending on the causative pathogen: gram-positive cocci (GPC),
gram-negative rods (GNRs), and Candida spp. For each group, we
examined the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of PB,
including differences in clinical features depending on the clearance
of PB. The main outcome variable was mortality, assessed as early
(30-day), late (30–90 day), and 90-day mortality. Results: Overall, we
identified 31,591 cases of single bacteremia; in 6709 (21.2%) cases,
the first blood culture was positive, and in 3124 (46.6%) cases, a
follow-up blood culture (FUBC) was performed. Of the cases with FUBCs,
414 (13.2%) were confirmed to be PB. The proportion of PB cases caused
by Candida spp. was significantly higher (29.6%, 67/226 episodes) than
that for GPC (11.1%, 220/1974 episodes, p < 0.001) and GNRs (12.1%,
100/824 episodes, p < 0.001). The Candida spp. group also had the
highest late (30–90 day) and 90-day mortality rates. In all three
pathogen groups, the subgroup without the clearance of PB tended to
have a higher mortality rate than the subgroup with clearance.
Conclusions: Patients with PB due to Candida spp. have a higher late
(30–90 day) and 90-day mortality rate than patients with PB due to GPC
or GNRs. In patients with PB, FUBCs and confirming the clearance of PB
are useful to improve the survival rate.

AB  - BACKGROUND

Gram-negative bacilli bacteremias (GNB-Bs) represent a major cause of
morbidity and mortality in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients. Aim of
this study was to investigate the role of follow-up blood cultures
(FUBCs) and the clinical significance of persistent bacteremia (PB) in
these settings.

METHODS

We retrospectively analyzed clinical data and outcome of GNB-Bs that
occurred in ICU patients over a span of 1 year. In particular we
sought information on development and clinical details of PB, defined
as repeatedly positive FUBCs after ≥96h of appropriate antibiotic
treatment and ≥48h after removal of endovascular devices.

RESULTS

Among 307 ICU patients, 69 (22.4%) developed 107 GNB-Bs. Out of these,
78 (73%) could be eventually analysed: 50/78 (64.1%) were non-PBs from
26 patients and 28/78 (35.9%) were PBs from 23 patients. Duration of
fever and bacteremia, time to procalcitonin normalization and weaning
from vasopressors were longer in episodes of PBs than non-PBs (p=0.04,
p<0.001, p=0.02 and p=0.004 respectively). Primary bacteremia was more
frequent in non-PBs than in PBs (29/50, 58% vs 3/28, 10.7%, p=0.0001),
whereas septic thrombus infection (STI) was the source of infection in
14/28 (50%). Finally, clinical features and 30-day mortality did not
differ between patients with PB and those who developed only non-PB
episodes.

CONCLUSIONS

Among our ICU patients, more than one third of GNB-Bs for which FUBCs
were performed resulted PB. This condition is often associated with
the presence of STI; therefore, FUBCs seem useful for the optimal
management of GNB in this clinical setting.

AB  - The presence of Corynebacterium in blood samples can indicate true
bacteremia or contamination, thus complicating the diagnosis of true
bacteremia. We aimed to evaluate the usefulness of time to positivity
(TTP) in diagnosing true bacteremia and contamination in cases where
Corynebacterium was isolated from blood samples. We compared the TTP
of the true-bacteremia group (n = 77) with that of the contamination
group (n = 88). For the true-bacteremia cases that had only one set of
positive blood cultures (n = 14), considering clinical and
bacteriological data, additional cultures were performed on blood or
other specimens. The same Corynebacterium spp. as in blood were
isolated from these specimens. Receiver operating characteristic
curves were generated, and the sensitivity and specificity of TTP were
calculated for diagnosing true bacteremia. The median TTP of the
true-bacteremia group (26.8 h) was shorter than that of the
contamination group (43.3 h) (P < 0.0001). When considering TTP ≤ 25.0
h as true bacteremia, the sensitivity and specificity were 44.2% and
95.5%, respectively. Moreover, when considering TTP ≤ 69.4 h as true
bacteremia, the sensitivity and specificity were 96.1% and 20.5%,
respectively. Among the true-bacteremia groups with one set of
positive blood cultures (n = 14), no case exhibited a TTP > 69.4 h.
Only three cases showed TTP ≤ 25.0 h in the true-bacteremia group with
one set of positive blood cultures. TTP > 69.4 h is likely to indicate
contamination and may be useful to exclude true bacteremia in cases
with one set of positive blood cultures. Meanwhile, diagnosing true
bacteremia using the threshold of TTP 25.0 h would be difficult.
Therefore, the clinical and bacteriological data are important for
diagnosing bacteremia, especially in cases with TTP ≤ 69.4 h.

AB  - BACKGROUND

Rapid identification of Gram-positive cocci in clusters (GPCC) in
positive blood cultures (pBC) may limit exposure to unnecessary or
inappropriate antibiotics.

METHODS

Inpatients with pBC showing GPCC between October 2013 and December
2017 were included. In the baseline period (BL), final ID and
susceptibility results were reported in the electronic medical record
(EMR) within 48 h of telephoned Gram stain report. The laboratory
introduced rapid phenotypic identification and direct susceptibility
testing (INT1), later replaced by PCR (INT2). In the last Intervention
(INT3), Antimicrobial Stewardship Response Team (ASRT) contacted
providers with PCR results and recommendations.

RESULTS

Time to directed therapy (TDT) for MSSA and coagulase-negative
Staphylococci (CoNS) decreased from BL to INT3 (48.5-17.9 h,
50.3-16.4 h, respectively). Time to ID from BL to INT3 for MSSA and
CoNS also decreased (23.2-1.9 h, 44.7-2.8, respectively).

CONCLUSIONS

TDT can be improved by modification of reporting methods with
utilization of an ASRT.

AB  - OBJECTIVES

Hospital-acquired bloodstream infections (HA-BSI) in the intensive
care unit (ICU) are common life-threatening events. We aimed to
investigate the association between early adequate antibiotic therapy
and 28-day mortality in ICU patients who survived at least 1 day after
the onset of HA-BSI.

METHODS

We used individual data from a prospective, observational,
multicentre, and intercontinental cohort study (Eurobact2). We
included patients who were followed for ≥1 day and for whom
time-to-appropriate treatment was available. We used an adjusted
frailty Cox proportional-hazard model to assess the effect of
time-to-treatment-adequacy on 28-day mortality. Infection- and
patient-related variables identified as confounders by the Directed
Acyclic Graph were used for adjustment. Adequate therapy within
24 hours was used for the primary analysis. Secondary analyses were
performed for adequate therapy within 48 and 72 hours and for
identified patient subgroups.

RESULTS

Among the 2418 patients included in 330 centres worldwide, 28-day
mortality was 32.8% (n = 402/1226) in patients who were adequately
treated within 24 hours after HA-BSI onset and 40% (n = 477/1192) in
inadequately treated patients (p < 0.01). Adequacy within 24 hours was
more common in young, immunosuppressed patients, and with HA-BSI due
to Gram-negative pathogens. Antimicrobial adequacy was significantly
associated with 28-day survival (adjusted Hazard Ratio (aHR), 0.83;
95% CI, 0.72-0.96; p 0.01). The estimated population attributable
fraction of 28-day mortality of inadequate therapy was 9.15% (95% CI,
1.9-16.2%).

DISCUSSION

In patients with HA-BSI admitted to the ICU, the population
attributable fraction of 28-day mortality of inadequate therapy within
24 hours was 9.15%. This estimate should be used when hypothesizing
the possible benefit of any intervention aiming at reducing the
time-to-appropriate antimicrobial therapy in HA-BSI.

AB  - Objective: To develop a novel clinical diagnostic method to
distinguish bacteremia from blood contamination due to
coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) by using the ratio of the time
to positivity (TTP) of a blood culture with positive results to its
serum procalcitonin (PCT) level. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed
the clinical and microbiological records of 102 patients who had 1 or
more blood cultures that tested positive for CNS from August 2007
through February 2012. Results: Receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) curve analysis indicated that, at a cutoff of 1.24 ng per mL,
21.5 hours, and 22.5 (hours × mL)/ng,the TTP to PCT ratio, PCT level,
and TTP yielded the most favorable discrimination for bacteremia
caused by CNS, with sensitivities of 85.7%, 78.6%, and
61.9%,respectively, and specificities of 80.0%, 78.3%, and
61.7%,respectively. The TTP to PCT ratio was the most accurate of the
studied variables in predicting CNS-triggered bacteremia levels.
Conclusion: The TTP to PCT ratio is a useful predictor to
differentiate the culture samples that test positive, revealing the
presence of CNS bacteremia, from those that are merely contaminated.

AB  - INTRODUCTION

Hospital-acquired bloodstream infections (HA-BSIs) are severe and
require antibiotic therapy. In non-complicated BSIs, shortened therapy
reduces side effects without compromising efficacy. The impact of
shortened antibiotic therapy in HA-BSI critically ill patients without
indication of prolonged therapy requires further evaluation.

METHODS

Using the international prospective EUROBACT-2 cohort, we compared
shortened (7-10 days) versus long (14-21 days) treatment durations in
ICU patients eligible for shortened therapy. Patients without
antibiotic therapy within 3 days after HA-BSI occurrence or requiring
prolonged therapy (due to infection source, microorganism, or clinical
deterioration) were excluded. Treatment failure, defined as death,
persistent infection, or subsequent infectious complications by Day
28, was assessed using an inverse-probability of treatment weighted
(IPTW) logistic regression.

RESULTS

Among 2600 patients, 550 were eligible for shortened treatment, 213
received short, and 337 received long treatment. The most common
infection source was intravascular catheters (33%), most common
microorganisms were Enterobacterales (39%). Patients with long
treatment were more frequently infected with Staphylococcus aureus
(11% vs. 5.6%, p = 0.025) or difficult-to-treat microorganisms (23%
vs. 7%, p < 0.001), and received more commonly combination therapy
(46% vs. 30%, p < 0.001). Short treatment was associated with reduced
28-day treatment failure (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.44-0.93, p = 0.019),
mainly due to reduction in subsequent infectious complications (OR
0.58, 95% CI 0.37-0.91, p = 0.018). Mortality (OR 0.92 [95% CI 0.59,
1.43], p = 0.7) and persistent infection rates (OR 0.47 [95% CI 0.17,
1.14], p = 0.12) were similar.

CONCLUSIONS

In selected ICU patients with HA-BSI, shortened antibiotic treatment
might be considered. Eurobact2 was a prospective international cohort
study, registered in ClinicalTrials.org (NCT03937245).

AB  - Abstract Objective: It remains unclear whether a follow-up blood
culture (FUBC) for gram-negative bacilli (GNB) bacteremia should be
routinely or selectively performed. To evaluate the value of the
practice, we analyzed the association between current FUBC practices
and length of stay, antibiotic treatment duration, and in-hospital
mortality. Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: The study was
conducted in 4 acute-care hospitals in New York City. Patients: The
study included hospitalized adults with GNB bacteremia between 2017
and 2018. Methods: An FUBC was defined as a blood culture performed
between 24 hours and 7 days after an initial blood culture positive
for GNB. Using propensity scores for FUBCs performed, patients were
matched 1:1 for outcome comparison. Results: In total, 376
hospitalized adults with GNB bacteremia met eligibility criteria.
Among them, FUBCs were performed in 271 patients (72%). After
propensity score matching, we analyzed 87 pairs of patients with and
without an FUBC to compare outcomes. The median length of stay was
longer among patients with FUBCs than patients without FUBCs (9 days
vs 7 days; P = .017). The median duration of antibiotic treatment was
also longer among patients with FUBCs than patients without FUBCs (8
vs 6 days; P = .007). No statistically significant difference was
observed in in-hospital mortality between patients with and without an
FUBC (odds ratio, 0.37; 95% confidence interval, 0.08–1.36).
Conclusions: Current FUBC practices for GNB bacteremia were associated
with prolonged length of stay and duration of antibiotic treatment.
Further data to better inform selectivity criteria for FUBCs in GNB
bacteremia are needed.

AB  - Prior studies have identified that vancomycin resistant enterococcus
(VRE) bacteremia that persists for four days or more is an independent
predictor of mortality. Despite this, there is no published data to
identify those patients at highest risk of developing persistent VRE
bacteremia.This was a single center, retrospective, case-control study
of adult patients with a VRE bloodstream infection (BSI). Case
patients were those with persistent bacteremia (≥ 4 days despite
VRE-directed therapy) and control patients were those with
non-persistent bacteremia. Logistic regression was used to assess risk
factors associated with persistent VRE BSIs. Secondary outcomes
included in-hospital mortality, recurrent bacteremia, and breakthrough
bacteremia.During the study period, 24/108 (22%) patients had
persistently positive blood cultures. Risk factors for persistent
bacteremia included severe neutropenia (OR 2.13), 4 out of 4 positive
index blood cultures (OR 11.29) and lack of source control (OR 11.88).
In an unadjusted analysis, no statistically significant differences in
in-hospital mortality (58% versus 40%; p = 0.121), recurrent
bacteremia (17% versus 6%; p = 0.090), or breakthrough bacteremia (13%
versus 7%; p = 0.402) were observed between groups.Patients with
severe neutropenia, 4 out of 4 positive index blood culture bottles,
and lack of source control were more likely to develop persistent VRE
bacteremia despite directed antibiotic treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND

Bloodstream infections in critically ill patients are associated with
mortality as high as 60% and a prolonged hospital stay. We evaluated
the impact of inappropriate antibiotic therapy (IAAT) in a critically
ill surgical cohort with bacteremia.

METHODS

This retrospective study evaluated adults with intensive care unit
admission greater than 72 hours and bacteremia. Two groups were
evaluated: appropriate antibiotic therapy (AAT) vs IAAT.

RESULTS

In 72 episodes of bacteremia, 57 (79%) AAT and 15 (21%) IAAT, mean age
was 54 ± 17 years and APACHE II of 17 ± 8. Time to appropriate
antibiotics was longer for IAAT (3 ± 5 IAAT vs 1 ± 1 AAT days, P =
.003). IAAT was seen primarily with Acinetobacter spp (33% IAAT vs 9%
AAT, P = .01) and Enterococcus faecium (26% IAAT vs 7% AAT, P = .03).
If 2 or more bacteremic episodes occurred, Acinetobacter spp. was more
likely, 32% vs 2%, P = .001.

CONCLUSIONS

AAT selection is imperative in critically patients with bacteremia to
reduce the significant impact of inappropriate selection. Repeated
episodes of bacteremia should receive special attention.

AB  - S. aureus bacteremia is associated with high mortality. The aim was to
identify predictors of mortality among patients with S. aureus
bacteremia and evaluate the role of early source control. This
retrospective study was conducted at the Lausanne University Hospital,
Switzerland. All episodes of S. aureus bacteremia among adult patients
from 2015 to 2021 were included. During the study period, 839 episodes
of S. aureus bacteremia were included, of which 7.9% were due to
methicillin-resistant isolates. Bacteremias were related to bone or
joint infections (268; 31.9%), followed by bacteremia of unknown
origin (158; 18.8%), proven endocarditis (118; 14.1%) and
lower-respiratory tract infections (79; 9.4%). Overall 28-day
mortality was 14.5%. Cox multivariate regression model showed that
Charlson comorbidity index > 5 (P < 0.001), nosocomial bacteremia (P
0.019), time to blood culture positivity ≤ 13 h (P 0.004), persistent
bacteremia for ≥ 48 h (P 0.004), sepsis (P < 0.001), bacteremia of
unknown origin (P 0.036) and lower respiratory tract infection (P <
0.001) were associated with 28-day mortality, while infectious
diseases consultation within 48 h from infection onset (P < 0.001) was
associated with better survival. Source control was warranted in 575
episodes and performed in 345 episodes (60.0%) within 48 h from
infection onset. Results from a second multivariate analysis confirmed
that early source control (P < 0.001) was associated with better
survival. Mortality among patients with S. aureus bacteremia was high
and early source control was a key determinant of outcome. Infectious
diseases consultation within 48 h played an important role in reducing
mortality.

AB  - Abstract Background Utilization of rapid identification methods for
positive blood cultures has been instrumental in the efforts of
antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs). Studies have shown that the
use of molecular testing techniques on positive blood cultures, which
identify select bacteria and their genetic resistance, have enabled
timelier initiation of targeted therapy. Type of Bacteremia Species of
bacteremia identified in both the standard identification period and
the identification by Verigene period Methods Data was collected via
chart review over two separate 6-month periods (7/1/2021- 1/1/2022 and
7/1/2022-1/1/2023), with Verigene BCID having been implemented in June
2022. The primary endpoint was the time to preferred therapy for
organisms reported in the Verigene gram-positive panel, including
MSSA, MRSA, Enterococcus species (faecalis and faecium), VRE, and
Streptococcus species. Demographic variables, the source of bacteremia
when established (i.e., skin/soft tissue, urinary, etc), as well as
interventions for source control were also collected. Source of
Bacteremia Results In this study, we analyzed a total of 168 cases of
gram-positive bacteremia. Among these, 94 cases occurred between
7/1/2021-1/1/2022 with identification via the standard method, while
74 cases occurred between 7/1/2022-1/1/2023 with identification via
Verigene BCID. The average age of patients at the onset of bacteremia
was 68 years, with a predominance of males (94.6%). Common underlying
comorbidities included diabetes (50%) and coronary artery disease
(48.7%). Regarding bacteremia etiology, 29.8% were caused by MSSA,
22.6% by MRSA, 32.7% by Streptococcus species, 11.3% by Enterococcus
spp, and 6% by VRE. The most common primary source of bacteremia was
identified as skin and soft tissue (34.5%). The time to administration
of preferred antibiotics, as defined by our ASP recommendations,
showed improvement across all gram-positive bacteremia types,
decreasing from a mean of 61.5 hours with standard identification

AB  - Introduction/Hypothesis: The timely administration of broad-spectrum
antibiotics with activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other
multi-drug resistant Gram-negative rods (GNRs) is a life-saving
therapy for critically ill patients with sepsis. While the CDC
advocates for a review of the indication, duration and choice of
antibiotics at 48hrs, the optimal timing of de-escalation in patients
with negative cultures to narrower spectrum antibiotics, like
ceftriaxone, remains unknown. Time to culture positivity has
previously been used to study the optimal timing for deescalation in
gram-positive cocci. We tested the hypothesis that cultures will
identify GNRs that ultimately demonstrate resistance to ceftriaxone
within 48 hours, allowing safe de-escalation at this time point.
Methods: Using the EHR, we evaluated patients whose respiratory and
blood cultures grew ceftriaxone resistant GNRs as a secondary analysis
of the 15,802 critically ill adults enrolled in the Isotonic Solutions
and Major Adverse Renal Events Trial (SMART), a pragmatic,
clusterrandomised, multiple-cross over trial of intravenous fluids.
Results: A total of 524 respiratory cultures from 304 (1.92%) patients
had growth of GNRs, of which 284 (54.2%) had resistance to
ceftriaxone. A total of 376 blood cultures from 311 (1.97%) patients
grew GNRs, of which 70 (18.6%) had resistance to ceftriaxone. For
cultures with resistance to ceftriaxone, the median (IQR) time from
collection to identification of GNRs was 33 (25-41) hours for
respiratory cultures and 21 (1831) hours for blood cultures. By 48
hours after collection, 87% of respiratory cultures and 85% of blood
cultures that would ultimately grow GNRs resistant to ceftriaxone had
demonstrated growth. At 72 hours, 98% of respiratory and 94% of blood
cultures demonstrated such growth. Delayed growth of respiratory and
blood cultures past 48hrs was not associated with preceding antibiotic
use (n=45, p=0.15) in a logistic regression analysis. Conclusions: In
a broad population of critically ill adults, 13% of respiratory and
15% of blood cultures ultimately growing ceftriaxone resistant GNRs
have not demonstrated growth at 48 hours. De-escalation from agents
targeting Pseudomonas aeruginosa and extended-spectrum β-lactamases
may not be advisable until cultures are negative for at least 72
hours.

AB  - Objectives The aim of this study was to identify prehospital and early
hospital risk factors associated with 30-day mortality in patients
with blood culture-confirmed community-acquired bloodstream infection
(CA-BSI) in Sweden. Methods A retrospective case–control study of 1624
patients with CA-BSI (2015–2016), 195 non-survivors satisfying the
inclusion criteria were matched 1:1 with 195 survivors for age, gender
and microorganism. All forms of contact with a healthcare provider for
symptoms of infection within 7 days prior CA-BSI episode were
registered. Logistic regression was used to analyse risk factors for
30-day all-cause mortality. Results Of the 390 patients, 61% (115
non-survivors and 121 survivors) sought prehospital contact. The
median time from first prehospital contact till hospital admission was
13 hours (6–52) for non-survivors and 7 hours (3–24) for survivors
(p<0.01). Several risk factors for 30-day all-cause mortality were
identified: prehospital delay OR=1.26 (95% CI: 1.07 to 1.47), p<0.01;
severity of illness (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score)
OR=1.60 (95% CI: 1.40 to 1.83), p<0.01; comorbidity score (updated
Charlson Index) OR=1.13 (95% CI: 1.05 to 1.22), p<0.01 and inadequate
empirical antimicrobial therapy OR=3.92 (95% CI: 1.64 to 9.33),
p<0.01. In a multivariable model, prehospital delay >24 hours from
first contact remained an important risk factor for 30-day all-cause
mortality due to CA-BSI OR=6.17 (95% CI: 2.19 to 17.38), p<0.01.
Conclusion Prehospital delay and inappropriate empirical antibiotic
therapy were found to be important risk factors for 30-day all-cause
mortality associated with CA-BSI. Increased awareness and earlier
detection of BSI in prehospital and early hospital care is critical
for rapid initiation of adequate management and antibiotic treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND

There is scarce data from the Indian subcontinent on the outcomes
following spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).

AIM

To study the immediate (within 30 days) and short-term mortality
(31-90 days) associated with SBP and to determine the predictors of
the same.

METHODS

This prospective observational study was done among patients with
liver cirrhosis who underwent paracentesis. Patient data included age,
gender, co-morbidity, cirrhosis-related complications, model of
end-stage liver disease (MELD), and Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) scores.
SBP was diagnosed based on ascitic fluid polymorphonuclear leukocyte
count > 250/mm

RESULTS

Of the 870 patients with cirrhosis and ascites registered during the
study period, 610 fulfilled the criteria for inclusion. Altogether,
122 patients with SBP were identified: 52 (42.6%) died, 40 (32.8%)
survived without liver transplant, and 30 (24.6%) underwent liver
transplantation within 3 months. Thirty-two patients (26.2%) were
blood culture posi tive for bacteria and 7 (5.7%) demonstrable
bacterial growth in ascitic fluid. Blood culture positivity was
significantly higher in the group with immediate mortality
(p < 0.0001) and was also significantly associated (p 0.005) with
mortality at 3 months.

CONCLUSION

Nearly two-fifths (42.6%) of the study cohort died within 3 months of
an episode of SBP. Four-fifths of these patients died within 30 days.
Blood culture positivity was significantly associated with immediate
and short-term mortality.

AB  - The role of follow up blood cultures (FUBC) in the management of
gram-negative bloodstream infection (GN-BSI) remains controversial.
This retrospective cohort study examines the association between
obtaining FUBC and mortality in GN-BSI.Hospitalized adults with
community-onset GN-BSI at Prisma Health-Midlands hospitals in South
Carolina, USA from January 1, 2010 to June 30, 2015 were identified.
Patients who died or were discharged from hospital within 72 h were
excluded to minimize impact of survival and selection biases on
results, respectively. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards
regression was used to examine association between obtaining FUBC and
28-day all-cause mortality after adjustment for the propensity to
obtain FUBC.Among 766 patients with GN-BSI, 219 (28.6%) had FUBC
obtained and 15 of 219 (6.8%) FUBC were persistently positive.
Overall, median age was 67 years, 438 (57%) were women, 457 (60%) had
urinary source of infection, and 426 (56%) had BSI due to Escherichia
coli. Mortality was significantly lower in patients who had FUBC
obtained than in those who did not have FUBC (6.3% vs. 11.7%, log-rank
p = 0.03). Obtaining FUBC was independently associated with reduced
mortality (hazards ratio 0.47, 95% confidence intervals: 0.23-0.87; p
= 0.02) after adjustments for age, chronic comorbidities, acute
severity of illness, appropriateness of empirical antimicrobial
therapy, and propensity to obtain FUBC.Improved survival in
hospitalized patients with GN-BSI who had FUBC is consistent with the
results of recent publications from Italy and North Carolina
supporting utilization of FUBC in management of GN-BSI.This study had
no funding source.

AB  - Abstract Background Delay in effective antibiotic administration in
severe infections such as bacteremia is associated with worse clinical
outcomes. We implemented previously validated software that uses
real-time predictive modeling to determine patient-specific
antibiograms (PS-ABG). The software allowed prescribers to run the
model on their individual patients. It also automatically evaluated
positive blood cultures, alerting the antibiotic stewardship team if
there was <90% chance of the organism being susceptible to current
antibiotic therapy. Methods We performed a quasi-experimental study to
evaluate clinical outcomes in patients with Gram-negative rod (GNR)
bacteremia 18 months before (PRE) and 6 months after (POST)
implementation of the software. Primary outcome was median time to
effective antibiotic. Secondary outcomes included in-hospital
mortality, utilization of antibiotics used for multidrug-resistant
GNRs (MDR-GNR), median time to effective antibiotic in organisms
resistant to at least one first-line antibiotic for sepsis, and length
of stay. Results The change per month in the primary outcome did not
differ between the PRE and POST periods (P = 0.48) (figure). Time to
effective antibiotics in GNR bloodstream infections that were
resistant to at least one first-line antibiotic for sepsis (cefepime,
piperacillin–tazobactam, or levofloxacin) was lower following the
intervention (15.8 hours vs. 13.7 hours, P = 0.11), and mortality
decreased following the intervention (14.6% vs. 10.0%, P = 0.11)
although these differences were not statistically significant. There
was no difference in other secondary outcomes between PRE and POST
groups: length of stay (7.7 vs. 7.5 days, P = 0.74) and days of
therapy of MDR-GNR agents per 30 days of hospitalization (3.5 vs. 2.5,
P = 0.09). Conclusion There was no difference in median time to
effective antibiotic in all patients with GNR bacteremia. There was
lower in-hospital mortality in the POST group and shorter time to
effective antibiotic therapy in GNR bacteremia resistant to at least
one first-line antibiotic for sepsis, although these differences were
not statistically significant. Additional study in larger cohorts over
longer periods is warranted to determine whether PS-ABGs improve
clinical outcomes in patients with more resistant GNR bacteremia.

AB  - BACKGROUND

Bacteremia is the second cause of death in hemodialysis patients and
colonization may be a risk factor. We analyzed the association between
Staphylococcus aureus or multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria
colonization and bacteremia in hemodialysis patients.

METHODS

A prospective cohort study was conducted. Colonization status was
determined at baseline, 2, and 6 months later. The
time-to-first-bacteremia was analyzed using the baseline status and
time-dependent nature of colonization. The recurrence of bacteremia
given colonization status was evaluated using a Poisson regression
model. The genetic relatedness between isolates that colonized and
caused bacteremia were established by molecular typing methods.

RESULTS

Seventy-one patients developed bacteremia over the course of
follow-up, with the majority of cases being caused by S aureus
(n = 28; 39.4%) and only three caused by multidrug-resistant
Gram-negative bacteria. S aureus colonization was associated with an
increased risk of bacteremia in time-dependent analysis (HR:4.64;
95%CI: 1.72-12.53) and with recurrence of infection in Poisson model
(IRR:5.90, 95%CI: 2.29-15.16). Molecular methods revealed that 77.8%
of patients with S aureus bacteremia were colonized with the same
strain that caused the infection.

CONCLUSIONS

S aureus is a cause of endogenous infection in hemodialysis patients.
Colonization is associated with both time-to-first-bacteremia and the
recurrence of infection. The prompt identification of colonized
patients and the evaluation of decolonization protocols are needed.

AB  - OBJECTIVE

The epidemiologic data of catheter related blood stream infections
(CRBSI) is different in each type of Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The
objectives were to identify microbiological patterns, risk factors and
mortality analysis in the surgical intensive care unit (SICU).

MATERIAL AND METHOD

All CRBSI cases were reviewed in a 60-months period from the 1st
ofJanuary, 2005 through the 31st of December, 2009. Two or three
control patients, who had been catheterized within three days and were
free of CRBSI, were randomly selected from the ICU admissions
registration book as the control group; demographic data, mortality,
organisms found and antibiotic sensitivity were recorded and analyzed.

RESULTS

In the 5-years period, 44 patients were diagnosed with a CRBSI and 129
patients who were without a CRBSI were selected. The total infection
rate was 1.31 per 1,000 catheter-days. Nine patients who contracted a
CRBSI (20.4%) expired. A primary diagnosis of gastrointestinal
problems had shown the greatest risk for developing a CRBSI (69.7%).
In proportions of gram negative bacteria:gram positive
bacteria:fungus, this was measured at 43:36:21 respectively.
Staphylococcus aureus was the most common gram positive bacteria
found. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas
aeruginosa were the three most common gram negative bacteria found.
The chance of developing a CRBSI was significantly increased after 10
days of catheterization. The mortality probability of gram negative
bacterial infections and fungal infections increased over time. This
was in contrast to gram positive bacterial infections, which decreased
over time despite having shown the highest possibility of death
earlier in catheter days. As for multivariable analyses,
catheterization of patients in the general wards was the sole
independent risk factor of CRBSI occurrences (OR = 8.67, p < 0.01) and
the males (OR = 7.20, p = 0.03) have shown the highest risk factors
for mortality.

CONCLUSION

The occurrence of gram-negative bacteria and gram-positive bacteria
related CRBSI was similar but the probability patterns of increasing
the catheter days relating to CRBSI occurrence and mortality rates
were different. Catheterization in the general wards was the only
independent risk factor found for contracting a CRBSI in our
institute. Males had the highest risk for mortality.

AB  - OBJECTIVES

To assess the outcome of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia (SAB)
according to factors associated with necessity for longer treatment in
conjunction with the duration of treatment.

METHODS

We prospectively collected the data of patients with SAB consecutively
during 12 to 39 months from 11 hospitals. If multiple episodes of SAB
occurred in one patient, only the first episode was enrolled. Factors
associated with necessity for longer treatment were defined as
follows: persistent bacteraemia, metastatic infection, prosthesis and
endocarditis. If any of the factors were present, then the case was
defined as longer antibiotic treatment warranted (LW) group; those
without any factors were defined as shorter antibiotic treatment
sufficient (SS) group. Poor outcome was defined as a composite of
90-day mortality or 30-day recurrence. Duration of antibiotic
administration was classified as <14 or ≥14 days in the SS group and
<28 or ≥28 days in the LW group.

RESULTS

Among 2098 cases, the outcome was analysed in 1866 cases, of which 591
showed poor outcome. The SS group accounted for 964 cases and the LW
group for 852. On multivariate analysis, age over 65 years, pneumonia,
higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and chronic
liver diseases were risk factors for poor outcome. Administration of
antibiotics less than the recommendation was associated with poor
outcome, but this significance was observed only in the LW group
(adjusted odds ratio = 1.68; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-2.83; p
0.05).

CONCLUSIONS

Inappropriately short antibiotic treatment was associated with poor
outcome in the LW group. Vigilant evaluation for risk factors to
determine the duration of treatment may improve the outcome among
patients with SAB.

AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of the BioFire
FilmArray Blood Culture Identification 2 (BCID2) Panel and
antimicrobial stewardship on clinical outcomes in patients with
organisms not covered by empiric regimens.

This was a single-center retrospective review comparing adults with
extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL), carbapenemase (CPE), or
AmpC-producing Enterobacterales, Acinetobacter baumannii,
Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, or Enterococcus spp. bloodstream
infections before and after BCID2 implementation. The primary outcome
was time from blood culture positivity to initiation of effective
therapy. Secondary outcomes included recurrence, resistance
development, readmission, Clostridioides difficile infection, and
30-day mortality.

The final cohort included 319 patients (pre-BCID2 n = 128, post-BCID2
n = 191), with a median age of 69 years (57–81). The majority of
patients had Enterococcus spp. (44%) or ESBL Enterobacterales (41%)
infections, and most had urinary (35%) or intra-abdominal (28%)
sources. Time to effective therapy was significantly shorter
post-BCID2 (7 hours vs 4 hours, P = 0.01), particularly among those
with ESBL (40 hours vs 5 hours, P < 0.01), high-risk AmpC-producing
organism (41 hours vs 6 hours, P = 0.17), and Enterococcus faecium
infections (17 hours vs 5 hours, P = 0.067). Antimicrobial stewardship
pharmacists performed interventions more frequently post-BCID2 (34% vs
49%, P < 0.01). There were no differences between groups in secondary
outcomes.

Implementation of the BCID2 Panel in conjunction with antimicrobial
stewardship was associated with shorter time to effective therapy.
Further studies are needed to understand the impact on patient-related
outcomes.

AB  - The incidence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bloodstream infections
(BSIs) is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Little
evidence exists regarding the epidemiology of BSIs and the use of
appropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy in endemic regions. Novel
diagnostic tests (RDTs) may facilitate and improve patient management.
Data were assessed from patients with MDR Gram-negative bacteremia at
a university tertiary hospital over a 12-month period. In total, 157
episodes of MDR Gram-negative BSI were included in the study. The
overall mortality rate was 50.3%. Rapid molecular diagnostic tests
were used in 94% of BSI episodes. In univariate analysis, age (OR 1.05
(95% CI 1.03, 1.08) p < 0.001), Charlson Comorbidity Index (OR 1.51
(95% CI 1.25, 1.83) p < 0.001), procalcitonin ≥ 1(OR 3.67 (CI 95%
1.73, 7.79) p < 0.001), and monotherapy with tigecycline (OR 3.64 (95%
CI 1.13, 11.73) p = 0.030) were the only factors associated with
increased overall mortality. Surprisingly, time to appropriate
antimicrobial treatment had no impact on mortality. MDR pathogen
isolation, other than Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter
baumanii, was associated with decreased mortality (OR 0.35 (95% CI
0.16, 0.79) p = 0.011). In multivariate analysis, the only significant
factor for mortality was procalcitonin ≥ 1 (OR 2.84 (95% CI 1.13,
7.11) p = 0.025). In conclusion, in an endemic area, mortality rates
in MDR BSI remain notable. High procalcitonin was the only variable
that predicted death. The use of rapid diagnostics did not improve
mortality rate.

AB  - Abstract Background Although the risk factors for positive follow-up
blood cultures (FUBCs) in gram-negative bacteremia (GNB) have not been
investigated extensively, FUBC has been routinely carried out in many
acute care hospitals. We attempted to identify the risk factors and
develop a predictive scoring model for positive FUBC in GNB cases.
Methods All adults with GNB in a tertiary care hospital were
retrospectively identified during a 2-year period, and GNB cases were
assigned to eradicable and non-eradicable groups based on whether
removal of the source of infection was possible. We performed
multivariate logistic analyses to identify risk factors for positive
FUBC and built predictive scoring models accordingly. Results Out of
1473 GNB cases, FUBCs were carried out in 1268 cases, and the results
were positive in 122 cases. In case of eradicable source of infection,
we assigned points according to the coefficients from the multivariate
logistic regression analysis: Extended spectrum
beta-lactamase-producing microorganism (+ 1 point), catheter-related
bloodstream infection (+ 1), unfavorable treatment response (+ 1),
quick sequential organ failure assessment score of 2 points or more (+
1), administration of effective antibiotics (− 1), and adequate source
control (− 2). In case of non-eradicable source of infection, the
assigned points were end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis (+ 1),
unfavorable treatment response (+ 1), and the administration of
effective antibiotics (− 2). The areas under the curves were 0.861
(95% confidence interval [95CI] 0.806–0.916) and 0.792 (95CI,
0.724–0.861), respectively. When we applied a cut-off of 0, the
specificities and negative predictive values (NPVs) in the eradicable
and non-eradicable sources of infection groups were 95.6/92.6% and
95.5/95.0%, respectively. Conclusions FUBC is commonly carried out in
GNB cases, but the rate of positive results is less than 10%. In our
simple predictive scoring model, zero scores—which were easily
achieved following the administration of effective antibiotics and/or
adequate source control in both groups—had high NPVs. We expect that
the model reported herein will reduce the necessity for FUBCs in GNB
cases.

AB  - Abstract Background Of all microbiological tests performed, blood
cultures have the most impact on patient care. Timely results are
essential, especially in the management of sepsis. While there are
multiple available blood culture systems on the market, they have
never been compared in a prospective study in a critically ill
population. Methods We performed an analysis of the FABLED study
cohort to compare culture results and time to positivity (TTP) of 2
widely used blood culture systems: BacT/Alert and BACTEC. In this
multisite prospective study, patients with severe manifestations of
sepsis had cultures drawn before antibiotics using systematic
enrollment criteria and blood drawing methodology allowing for
minimization of pre-analytical biases. Results We enrolled 315
patients; 144 had blood cultures (47 positive) with BacT/Alert and 171
with BACTEC (53 positive). Patients whose blood cultures were
processed using the BacT/Alert system were younger (median, 64 vs 70
years; P = .003), had a higher proportion of HIV (9.03% vs 1.75%;
P = .008) and a lower qSOFA (P = .003). There were no statistically
significant differences in the most commonly identified bacterial
species. TTP was shorter for BACTEC (median [interquartile range
{IQR}], 12.5 [10–14] hours) compared with BacT/Alert (median [IQR], 17
[14–21] hours; P < .0001). Conclusions In this large prospective
multi-centre study comparing the two blood culture systems among
patients with severe manifestations of sepsis, and using a rigorous
pre-analytical methodology, the BACTEC system yielded positive culture
results 4.5 hours earlier than BacT/Alert. These results apply to
commonly isolated bacteria. However, our study design did not allow
direct comparison of TTP for unusual pathogens nor of clinical
sensitivity between systems. More research is needed to determine the
clinical implications of this finding.

AB  - Abstract Background The association between blood culture status and
mortality among sepsis patients remains controversial hence we
conducted a tri-center retrospective cohort study to compare the early
and late mortality of culture-negative versus culture-positive sepsis
using the inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) method.
Methods Adult patients with suspected sepsis who completed the blood
culture and procalcitonin tests in the emergency department or
hospital floor were eligible for inclusion. Early mortality was
defined as 30-day mortality, and late mortality was defined as 30- to
90-day mortality. IPTW was calculated from propensity score and was
employed to create two equal-sized hypothetical cohorts with similar
covariates for outcome comparison. Results A total of 1405 patients
met the inclusion criteria, of which 216 (15.4%) yielded positive
culture results and 46 (21.3%) died before hospital discharge. The
propensity score model showed that diabetes mellitus, urinary tract
infection, and hepatobiliary infection were independently associated
with positive blood culture results. There was no significant
difference in early mortality between patients with positive or
negative blood culture results. However, culture-positive patients had
increased late mortality as compared with culture-negative patients in
the full cohort (IPTW-OR, 1.95, 95%CI: 1.14–3.32) and in patients with
severe sepsis or septic shock (IPTW-OR, 1.92, 95%CI: 1.10–3.33). After
excluding Staphylococcal bacteremia patients, late mortality
difference became nonsignificant (IPTW-OR, 1.78, 95%CI: 0.87–3.62).
Conclusions Culture-positive sepsis patients had comparable early
mortality but worse late mortality than culture-negative sepsis
patients in this cohort. Persistent Staphylococcal bacteremia may have
contributed to the increased late mortality.

AB  - Background: The optimal timing for the de-escalation of broad-spectrum
antibiotics with activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and resistant
Gram-negative rods (GNRs) in critically ill adults remains unknown.
Research Question: We tested the hypothesis that cultures will
identify GNRs that ultimately demonstrate resistance to ceftriaxone
within 48 hours, potentially allowing safe de-escalation at this time
point. Study Design and Methods: We conducted a secondary analysis of
data from the Isotonic Solutions and Major Adverse Renal Events Trial:
a pragmatic, cluster-randomized, multiple-crossover trial comparing
balanced crystalloids versus saline for intravenous fluid
administration in 15,802 critically ill adults at 5 intensive care
units (ICUs) at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, TN,
USA. The primary endpoint was the time-to-positivity of respiratory
and blood cultures that ultimately demonstrated growth of GNRs
resistant to ceftriaxone. Multivariable logistic regression modeling
was used to examine risk factors for the growth of cultures after 48
hours. Results: A total of 524 respiratory cultures had growth of
GNRs, of which 284 (54.2%) had resistance to ceftriaxone. A total of
376 blood cultures grew GNRs, of which 70 (18.6%) had resistance to
ceftriaxone. At 48 hours, 87% of respiratory cultures and 85% of blood
cultures that ultimately grew GNRs resistant to ceftriaxone had
demonstrated growth. Age, gender, predicted risk of inpatient
mortality and prior use of antibiotics did not predict the growth of
cultures after 48 hours. Interpretation: Among a cohort of critically
ill adults, 13% of respiratory cultures and 15% of blood cultures that
ultimately grew GNRs resistant to ceftriaxone did not demonstrate
growth until at least 48 hours after collection. Further work is
needed to determine the ideal time for critically ill adults to
de-escalate from broad-spectrum antibiotics targeting Pseudomonas
aeruginosa and extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing gram-negative
pathogens.

AB  - Abstract Bacteremia is associated with high morbidity and mortality,
but the utility and optimal timing of follow-up blood cultures (FUBCs)
remain undefined. To assess the optimal timing of FUBCs related to
appropriate antibiotic therapy (AAT), adults with community-onset
bacteremia and FUBCs after bacteremia onset were retrospectively
studied during the 6-year period in two hospitals. Based on the time
gap between the initiation of AAT and FUBC sampling, 1,247 eligible
patients were categorized as FUBCs prior to AAT (65 patients, 5.2%),
0–3 days (202, 16.2%), 3.1–6 days (470, 37.7%), 6.1–9 days (299,
24.0%), and ≥9 days (211, 16.9%) after AAT. The prognostic impact of
the growth of the same bacteria in FUBCs on 30-day mortality was
evidenced only in patients with FUBCs at 3.1–6 days after AAT
(adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 3.75; P &lt; 0.001), not in those with
FUBCs prior to AAT (AOR, 2.86; P = 0.25), 0–3 days (AOR, 0.39; P =
0.08), 6.1–9 days (AOR, 2.19; P = 0.32), and ≥9 days (AOR, 0.41; P =
0.41) of AAT, after adjusting independent factors of 30-day mortality
recognized by the multivariable regression in each category.
Conclusively, persistent bacteremia in FUBCs added prognostic
significance in the management of adults with community-onset
bacteremia after 3.1–6 days of AAT.

AB  - Enterococcal bloodstream infections (EBSI) caused by
vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) are associated with a
significant rate of unfavorable outcomes. No definitive data have been
reported about the association between delayed antibiotic therapy and
mortality. In this prospective observational study in three large
hospitals in Italy (from August 2016 to April 2021), all consecutive
hospitalized patients with a confirmed diagnosis of hospital-acquired
monomicrobial BSI caused by VRE—with no evidence of endocarditis—were
analyzed. Cox regression analysis showed that risk factors
independently associated with 30-day mortality were age (HR 2.98,
CI95% 1.44–6.81, p = 0.002), chronic kidney disease (HR 5.21, CI95%
1.48–22.23, p = 0.001), oncologic disease (HR 2.81, CI95% 1.45–19.8, p
= 0.005), and intensive care unit admission (HR 3.71, CI95% 2.23–7.99,
p < 0.001). Conversely, early effective therapy was associated with
survival (HR 0.32, CI95% 0.38–0.76, p < 0.001). The administration of
early effective antibiotic therapy within 48 h from blood culture
collection was associated with 30-day mortality rates lower than 33%.
Time from blood culture collection to appropriate therapy was an
independent predictor of 30-day mortality in patients with EBSI caused
by VRE. Based on these data, clinicians should start effective
antibiotic therapy as soon as possible, preferably within the first 48
h from blood culture collection. Treatment strategies allowing the
early delivery of in vitro active antibiotics are urgently needed,
especially in critically ill patients at risk of VRE bacteremia.

AB  - PURPOSE

Blood culture obtainment prior to antibiotic administration, in
patients with suspected infection, is considered the best practice in
international guidelines. However, there is little data regarding the
effect of a single dose of antibiotics on blood culture sterilization.

METHODS

We conducted a prospective study, enrolling consecutive patients with
suspected infection, hospitalized in an internal medicine ward between
December 2019 and January 2023. Included patients had a positive blood
culture prior to antibiotic administration and a set of blood cultures
taken within 24 h after a single dose of antibiotics. The rate of
patients with pathogen isolation after antibiotic administration was
assessed. Logistic regression was performed to examine factors
associated with blood culture positivity.

RESULTS

A total of 155 patients were recruited for the study of which 131
(50.8% female 77.5 ± 13.4 years) met the inclusion criteria. The
overall rate of patients with a positive blood culture after a single
dose of antibiotics was 42.0% (55/131 patients). Increasing time
between antibiotic administration and post-antibiotic culture was an
independent predictor for blood culture sterilization (odds ratio 0.89
[95% confidence interval, 0.83-0.97; p = 0.006] for every 60 min).
Blood culture volume was an independent predictor for blood culture
positivity in a sensitivity analysis which included 82 patients
(OR = 1.26 [95% CI 1.03-1.57] for every 1 ml increase; p = 0.024).

CONCLUSION

Blood culture positivity is reduced by antimicrobial therapy but
remains high after a single dose of antibiotics. If cultures are not
obtained prior to antibiotic administration, they should be obtained
as soon as possible afterwards.

AB  - Background This retrospective study was designed to assess risk
factors for increased 30-day mortality from bacteremia caused by
Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae and to calculate the optimal
point of time for patients to move from inappropriate empirical
antimicrobial therapy to appropriate treatment. Material/Methods This
retrospective study analyzed data from 610 patients with a diagnosis
of E. coli- and K. pneumoniae-induced bacteremia collected between
2020 and 2023, including population-based information, infection
bacteria, comorbidities, and treatment duration. Patients were
categorized into 2 groups based on whether they received appropriate
empirical antibiotic therapy (AEAT) or inappropriate empirical
antibiotic therapy (IEAT). Propensity score-matched (PSM) analysis was
performed using 1: 1 nearest neighbor matching. Receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curve analysis determined the time point for
patients in the IEAT group to transition to appropriate therapy.
Results The study found that 30-day mortality was higher in the IEAT
group than in the AEAT group (P=0.043). Multifactorial Cox regression
analysis after PSM indicated that Pitt score (P<0.001), age-adjusted
Charlson comorbidity index score (P<0.001), and inappropriate
treatment days (P=0.018) were independent risk factors for increased
30-day mortality. The area under the ROC curve value was 0.613, and
the maximum Youden index corresponded to a time turning point of 8
days. Conclusions Pitt and aCCI scores and inappropriate treatment
days are significant risk factors for increased 30-day mortality in
patients with E. coli or K. pneumoniae. Timely transition from
inappropriate antibiotic to appropriate antibiotic therapy within 8
days was found to improve survival.

AB  - BACKGROUND

Limited data are available regarding the current microbiological
characteristics of bloodstream infections (BSIs) in intensive care
units (ICUs) in China. This retrospective study aimed to determine the
epidemiology of early- and late-onset BSIs in our ICU.

METHODS

We retrospectively collected data about ICU patients with BSI from
2013 to 2017. The patients were divided into the early- and late-onset
BSI groups according to if BSI occurred within or beyond 48 hours
after ICU admission. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression
analyses were used to assess the risk factors for infection with
multidrug resistant organisms (MDROs).

RESULTS

Of 5474 ICU admissions, 486 (8.9%) patients with BSIs and with 500
microorganisms were included in this study, 246 (50.6%) of whom had
early-onset BSIs. Two hundred and seventy patients were infected with
MDROs. The proportion of MDRO infections was significantly higher
among patients with late-onset BSIs than among those with early-onset
BSIs (57.9% vs. 41.5%, P = .017). The ICU mortality rate was
significantly higher in the late-onset BSI group (44.6% vs. 33.8%, P =
.014) and early and appropriate antimicrobial treatment significantly
improved the survival rate among patients with BSI (P < .001).

CONCLUSIONS

MDROs affected more than half of patients with BSI in the ICU. Early
appropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy could improve clinical
outcome of patients with BSIs.

AB  - The knowledge of the expected time-to-positivity (TTP) of blood
cultures by major pathogens is essential both clinically and
economically. To this end, we conducted the present two-year study in
our Institution, aiming to assess the TTP of all the major
microorganisms including Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
Acinetoacter baumannii, Enterococcii spp, Staphylococcus aureus and
yeasts, to determine whether a 3-day interval is sufficient for their
detection. The TTP for each case of strain isolation per patient was
determined as the TTP of the first bottle among a set of bottles
collected within the same period of time to be flagged as positive per
patient. Based on our results, almost all major Gram-negative
(99.30%), Gram-positive microbia (99.01%) and yeasts (98.85%) were
detected within the first 5-days of incubation, leading to the solid
conclusion that a 5-day period of incubation is adequate to detect
almost all the major routine pathogens. By contrast, when a 3-day
period was examined acceptable results were only found for
Gram-negative (98.33%) and Gram-positive (98.51%) microbia. A
significant proportion of yeasts (8.05%) could not be detected within
this time frame. Therefore, regarding the yeasts, a 3-day incubation
period cannot be considered as adequate and is not advocated.

AB  - BACKGROUND

Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) via central venous catheters has
improved nutrient delivery to patients unable to receive nutrition
enterally, but its administration can be complicated by bacteremia and
fungemia.

METHODS

At a large tertiary-care academic medical center, 245 patients with
concurrent positive blood cultures, among 1,716 adult patients who
received TPN over a period of three consecutive years, were divided
into those in whom parenteral nutrition was continued and those in
whom it was stopped after the occurrence of a positive blood culture.
To determine whether continuation of TPN after a positive blood
culture was associated with a statistically significantly longer
hospitalization than with its discontinuation after a positive blood
culture, we performed a logistic regression analysis with step-wise
selection, with parenteral nutrition status as the dependent variable
and type of venous access, type of pathogen responsible for a positive
blood culture, recurrence of a positive blood culture, respiratory
failure, shock, and length of stay as covariates.

RESULTS

The prevalence of positive blood cultures was 14% among all
hospitalized patients given parenteral nutrition. Parenteral nutrition
was continued in 60% of the patients. Baseline co-morbid and
laboratory parameters were comparable in the group of patients in whom
TPN was continued and the group in which it was stopped except that
the white blood cell count (WBC) was lower in the former group
(9.1±6.6 mm(3) vs. 12±12.1 mm(3), p=0.015). Both groups received an
average of 30 kcal/kg and 1.4 g protein/kg via TPN. There was no
difference in the two groups in total calories, lipids, protein, or
glutamine-base received before the occurrence of a positive blood
culture (p=0.86, p=0.51, p=0.79, and p=0.42, respectively). The
hospital stay of the group in which TPN was continued after a positive
blood culture was statistically significantly longer than that of the
group in which it was discontinued (44.6±32.3 d vs. 28.2±18.5 d,
p<0.001). This difference remained significant in the multivariable
logistic regression analysis.

CONCLUSION

Continuation of TPN after a positive blood culture was associated with
statistically significantly longer hospitalization before and after
adjustment for co-morbid conditions.

patients with sepsis. Methods: A prospective cohort study in a
tertiary referral hospital in Medellín, Colombia. Adults older than 18
years of age with a bacterial infection diagnosis according to Centers
for Disease Control criteria and sepsis (evidence of organ
dysfunction) were included. A logistic regression model was used to
determine the association between positive cultures and hospital
mortality, and a Cox regression with a competing risk modeling
approach was used to determine the association between positive
cultures and hospital stay as well as secondary infections. Results:
Overall, 408 patients had positive cultures, of which 257 were blood
culture, and 153 had negative cultures. Patients with positive
cultures had a lower risk of mortality (odds ratio [OR], 0.43; 95%
confidence interval [CI], 0.27-0.68), but this association was not
maintained after adjusting for confounding factors (OR, 0.56; 95% CI,
0.31-1.01). No association was found with the hospital stay (adjusted
subhazard ratio [SHR], 1.06; 95% CI, 0.83-1.35). There was no
association between positive cultures and the presence of secondary
infections (adjusted SHR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.58-1.71). Conclusion:
Positive cultures are not associated with prognosis in patients with
sepsis.

AB  - PURPOSE

The purpose of this study is to improve the quality of care and
patient outcomes for Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia.

METHODS

A quasi-experimental pre- and postintervention study design was used
to compare process and clinical endpoints before and after a
quality-improvement initiative. All inpatients >18 years of age with a
positive blood culture for S. aureus during the specified pre- and
postintervention period with clinical information available in the
electronic medical record were included. An institutional protocol for
the care of patients with S. aureus bacteremia was developed,
formalized, and distributed to providers using a pocket card, an
electronic order set, and targeted lectures over a 9-month period.

RESULTS

There were 167 episodes of S. aureus bacteremia (160 patients)
identified in the preintervention period, and 127 episodes (123
patients) in the postintervention period. Guideline adherence improved
in the postintervention period for usage of transesophageal
echocardiogram (43.9% vs 20.2%, P <.01) and adequate duration of
intravenous therapy (71% vs 60%, P = .05). In a multivariate Cox
proportional hazard model, the variables associated with increased
relapse-free survival were postintervention period (hazard ratio [HR]
0.48; confidence interval [CI], 0.24-0.95; P .035) and appropriate
source control (HR 0.53; CI, 0.24-0.92; P .027). Regardless of
intervention, presence of cancer was associated with an increased risk
of relapse or mortality at 90 days (HR 2.88; P <.0001; CI, 1.35-5.01).

CONCLUSION

A bundled educational intervention to promote adherence to published
guidelines for the treatment of S. aureus bacteremia resulted in a
significant improvement in provider adherence to guidelines as well as
increased 90-day relapse-free survival.

AB  - INTRODUCTION

Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia is associated with significant
morbidity and mortality. Given the paucity of recent Canadian data, we
estimated the mortality rate associated with S. aureus bacteremia in a
tertiary care hospital and identified risk factors associated with
mortality.

METHODS

We retrospectively reviewed the records of adults with S. aureus
bacteremia admitted to a tertiary care centre in southwestern Ontario
between 2008 and 2012. Cox regression analysis was used to evaluate
associations between predictor variables and all-cause, in-hospital,
and 90-day postdischarge mortality.

RESULTS

Of the 925 patients involved in the study, 196 (21.2%) died in
hospital and 62 (6.7%) died within 90 days after discharge. Risk
factors associated with in-hospital and all-cause mortality included
age, sepsis (adjusted hazard ratio [adjusted HR] 1.49, 95% confidence
interval [CI] 1.08-2.06, p = 0.02), admission to the intensive care
unit (adjusted HR 3.78, 95% CI 2.85-5.02, p < 0.0001), hepatic failure
(adjusted HR 3.36, 95% CI 1.91-5.90, p < 0.0001) and metastatic cancer
(adjusted HR 2.58, 95% CI 1.77-3.75, p < 0.0001). Methicillin
resistance, hepatic failure, cerebrovascular disease, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease and metastatic cancer were associated
with postdischarge mortality.

INTERPRETATION

The all-cause mortality rate in our cohort was 27.9%. Identification
of predictors of mortality may guide empiric therapy and provide
prognostic clarity for patients with S. aureus bacteremia.

AB  - OBJECTIVE To investigate the value of time to positivity(TTP)of blood
cultures in predicting clinical characteristics and prognosis of
patients with bloodstream infections caused by Staphylococcus
aureus.METHODS Based on predetermined enrolling criteria,the clinical
data and TTP of the hospitalized patients with blood culture positive
for S.aureus from 2008to 2012were collected,then the patients were
divided into the high TTP group and the low TTP group,with the integer
number nearest to the median TTP as the cut-off point.The clinical
variables of two groups were compared statistically.Logistic
regression analysis was performed to determine whether or not the TTP
was an independent risk factor for these
variables.Receiver-operating-characteristic(ROC)curves were used to
analyze the diagnostic value of TTP.RESULTS Totally 73patients with
intact clinical data who met the enrolling criteria were
enrolled,including 36cases in the low TTP group and 37cases in the
high TTP group;there were significant differences in the severe sepsis
and septic shock,catheter-related infection,and mortality during
hospital stay between the low TTP group and the high TTP
group(P0.05).The TTP less than 16hwas the independent risk factor for
the three variables.The TTP less than16.72h,TTP less than 18.27h,and
TTP less than 13.85hwere the optimal cut-off points to predict the
three variables,with the areas under the curve(AUC)of 0.763,0.633,and
0.724,respectively.CONCLUSIONThe low TTP is the independent risk
factor for severe sepsis and septic shock,catheter related
infection,and poor prognosis,and the accuracies of TTP for predicting
the three variables are moderate,low,and moderate,respectively.

AB  - BACKGROUND

Despite the availability of antimicrobial therapies, Gram-negative
bacteremia remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality on a
global level. Recent randomized controlled trials support shorter
antibiotic treatment duration for individuals with uncomplicated
Gram-negative bacteremia. The target trial framework using the cloning
approach utilizes real-world data but eliminates the issue of immortal
time bias seen in observational studies by emulating the analysis of
randomized trials with full adherence.

METHOD

A hypothetical target trial allocating individuals with Gram-negative
bacteremia to either short antibiotic treatment duration (5-7 days) or
longer antibiotic treatment duration (8-14 days) was specified and
emulated using the cloning, censoring, and weighting approach. The
primary outcome was 90-day all-cause mortality. Secondary outcome was
a composite endpoint of clinical and microbiological relapse. The
emulated trial included individuals from four hospitals in Copenhagen
from 2018 through 2021.

RESULTS

1040 individuals were included. The median age of the cohort was 76
years, the majority were male (54%), had community-acquired
Gram-negative bacteremia (86%), urinary tract infection as the source
of the infection (78%), and Escherichia coli as the pathogen of the
infection (73%). The adjusted 90-day risk difference in all-cause
mortality was 1.3 (95% CI -0.7, 3.3), and the risk ratio was 1.12 (95%
CI 0.89, 1.37). The adjusted 90-day risk difference in relapse was 0.7
(95% CI -2.3, 3.8), and the risk ratio was 1.07 (95% CI 0.71, 1.45).

CONCLUSION

We found comparative outcomes for shorter treatment duration compared
to longer treatment duration in patients with Gram-negative
bacteremia.

AB  - PURPOSE

The value of follow-up blood culture (FUBC) in Gram-negative
bacteremia (GNB) management is controversial. We evaluated bedside
risk predictors and their probabilities of yielding positive FUBCs in
GNB.

METHODS

All adult patients with GNB in a 2700-bed tertiary center were
retrospectively enrolled between January 2019 and December 2019. Only
one initial GNB episode was included per patient. Positive FUBC was
defined as isolation of the same organism in blood culture 48-72 h
after the initial blood culture.

RESULTS

A total of 2216 patients with GNB were identified, of whom 34.4%
underwent FUBC. Of the 645 patients with FUBCs analyzed in the study,
89 (13.8%) had positive FUBCs. In multivariate analysis, hemodialysis
[adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 2.6], fever on the day of FUBCs (aOR 3.6),
intravascular device (aOR 2.4), no use of in vitro active antibiotic
within 24 h (aOR 2.5), non-fermenting bacteria (aOR 4.7), and
multidrug resistance (aOR 5.4) were independent risk factors for
positive FUBCs. If microbiological results were excluded in
multivariate analysis, hemodialysis, immunosuppressive treatment,
fever on the day of FUBCs, and intravascular device were independent
bedside risk predictors for positive FUBCs. The yield of FUBCs
increased from 3.0% (95% CI 1.0-7.0) to 63.6% (95% CI 25.6-100) as the
number of bedside risk predictors increased from 0 to 4. In addition,
positive FUBCs were significantly associated with 30 day mortality.

CONCLUSIONS

FUBCs may not need to be routinely used for patients with GNB
bacteremia, and bedside risk predictors could be helpful in
identifying patients for whom FUBC is likely to be useful.

AB  - Abstract Background Early organism identification via rapid
diagnostics has been shown to reduce time to effective antimicrobial
therapy and improve patient outcomes in patients with bacteremia, but
antimicrobial susceptibility testing is still required to optimize
therapy. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of an
institution-specific rapid susceptibility testing method on outcomes
in patients with bacteremia. Methods This was a retrospective pre- and
post-intervention study of 100 adult patients with bacteremia.
Patients were excluded if they had polymicrobial infection, fungemia,
blood cultures collected at outside hospitals, or if they expired
prior to susceptibility results. Patients were identified through a
report containing positive blood cultures from October 2017 to
February 2018 (pre-intervention [PrI]) and October 2018 to February
2019 (post-intervention [PoI]). The primary endpoint was the rate of
clinical failure (a composite of 28-day mortality or bacteremia
persisting greater than 6 days). Secondary endpoints included
microbiologic outcomes, time to effective and optimal therapy, length
of stay (LOS) and therapy adjustments. Results Baseline
characteristics were similar between groups; a third of the patients
were immunosuppressed (Table 1). The most common sources of infection
were urinary and intra-abdominal, and the most common organisms
identified were E.coli and Klebsiella spp. No significant difference
in the rate of clinical failure was identified between PrI and PoI
(24% vs. 18%, P = 0.6242) (Table 2). In the PoI, the time to
identification, susceptibility results, and effective therapy was
significantly shorter with similar time to optimal therapy and LOS. In
the PoI, antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP) interventions were
made significantly sooner after susceptibility results. Conclusion In
this small, retrospective, single-center study, the implementation of
a rapid susceptibility testing method was associated with reduced time
to susceptibility results and more rapid interventions by the ASP, but
no difference in the rate of clinical failure or time to optimal
therapy was identified. Disclosures All authors: No reported

AB  - Background Few studies have studied the relationship between blood
culture and mortality in sepsis patients. The aim of this study was to
compare the characteristics and outcomes of positive and negative
blood culture sepsis. Methods We performed a study on 640 patients
suffering from sepsis in Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital from October 2017
to December 2019. The primary findings revolved around length and
expenditure of hospital stay, the possibility of suffering from acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and any requirements for
mechanical ventilation. The secondary findings revolved around whether
the patient died early (28-day) or late (28-to-90-day). Results A
total of 592 of the 640 patients met the inclusion criteria for
sepsis, with 274 of them having culture-positive results. The
culture-positive patients were mostly elderly suffering from diabetes
and at risk of cancer, with a higher white blood cell count, and
higher procalcitonin. Additionally, they scored higher in their acute
physiology and chronic health evaluation II score (15 vs.11, P=0.010),
as well as in their predisposition, infection, response, and organ
dysfunction (17 vs 11, P<0.001) than the individuals in the
culture-negative group. Culture-positive patients had a longer
duration of hospital stay (14 vs 6, P<0.001) and higher in-hospital
mortality (14.6% vs 8.5%, P=0.019) than culture-negative ones. No
significant difference in intensive care unit (ICU) mortality (45.7%
vs.36.4%, P=0.254) or early mortality (9.5% vs 7.2%, P=0.321) was
noted between the two groups. However, the culture-positive patients
had increased late mortality (15.7% vs.6.9%, P=0.001), when compared
with those with culture-negative results in the cohort. Furthermore,
the culture-positive patients who received the appropriate antibiotics
early had a lower mortality rate than the culture-negative patients
(7.3% vs.14.2%, P=0.008). Conclusion Culture-positive patients had
higher in-hospital mortality, comparable early mortality, and worse
late mortality than the culture-negative patients. Early appropriate
use of antibiotics might reduce mortality and improve clinical
prognosis.

AB  - BackgroundThe optimal duration of therapy for bloodstream infections
due to Gram-negative bacteremia has been poorly defined. The objective
of this study was to determine if short courses of antimicrobial
therapy were noninferior to intermediate and long courses of
antimicrobial therapy for Gram-negative bacteremia. MethodsWe reviewed
medical records on patients with a documented Gram-negative bacteremia
from August 2006 to November 2013. Patients meeting eligibility
criteria were placed in the short-course, intermediate-course, and
long-course treatment groups if their duration of antimicrobial
therapy was less than or equal to 7 days, between 8 to 14 days, or
greater than 14 days, respectively. The primary outcome was the
achievement of a clinical response at the end of therapy. Secondary
outcomes included achievement of microbiological cure at the end of
therapy, and association of clinical response in each group with the
causative organism, source of bacteremia, and time to defervescence.
ResultsOf 406 cases of Gram-negative bacteremia, 178 cases met
eligibility criteria. Median age was 64 years with 67% females. Median
SAPS II (Simplified Acute Physiology Score II) was 33 points. The most
common infecting pathogen was Escherichia coli (46%), followed by
Klebsiella pneumoniae (22%). The most common source of bacteremia was
the urinary tract (53%), followed by indwelling catheters (14%).
Clinical response rates at the end of therapy were 78.6%, 89.0%, and
80.6% for the short-course, intermediate-course, and long-course
treatment groups, respectively (P = 0.2). Microbiological cure rates
at the end of therapy were 83.3%, 89.0%, and 91.7% for the
short-course, intermediate-course, and long-course treatment groups,
respectively (P = 0.7). Logistic regression analysis did not reveal
any association of clinical response in each group with infecting
organism (P = 0.4), source of bacteremia (P = 0.5), or time to
defervescence (P = 0.6). ConclusionsShort-course therapy for
Gram-negative bacteremia appears to achieve similar clinical response
rates and microbiological cure rates compared with intermediate- and
long-course therapy.

AB  - Abstract Background Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) is
associated with 30-day all-cause mortality rates approaching 20–30%.
The purpose of this case–control study was to evaluate risk factors
for 30-day mortality in patients with SAB at a community hospital.
Methods As part of an antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP)
initiative mandating Infectious Diseases consultation for episodes of
SAB, our ASP prospectively monitored all cases of SAB at a 341-bed
community hospital in Jefferson Hills, PA from April 2017–February
2019. Cases included patients with 30-day mortality from the initial
positive blood culture. Only the first episode of SAB was included;
patients were excluded if a treatment plan was not established (e.g.,
left against medical advice). Patient demographics, comorbidities,
laboratory results, and clinical management of SAB were evaluated.
Inferential statistics were used to analyze risk factors associated
with 30-day mortality. Results 100 patients with SAB were included; 18
(18%) experienced 30-day mortality. Cases were older (median age 76.5
vs. 64 years, P < 0.001), more likely to be located in the intensive
care unit (ICU) at time of ASP review (55.6% vs. 30.5%, P = 0.043),
and less likely to have initial blood cultures obtained in the
emergency department (ED) (38.9% vs. 80.5%, P < 0.001). Variables
associated with significantly higher odds for 30-day mortality in
univariate analysis: older age, location in ICU at time of ASP review,
initial blood cultures obtained at a location other than the ED, and
total Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). Variables with P < 0.2 on
univariate analysis were analyzed via multivariate logistic regression
(Table 1). Conclusion Results show that bacteremia due to MRSA and
total CCI were not significantly associated with 30-day mortality in
SAB, whereas older age was identified as a risk factor. Patients with
initial blood cultures obtained at a location other than the ED were
at increased odds for 30-day mortality on univariate analysis, which
may raise concern for delayed diagnosis. Disclosures All authors: No

AB  - Abstract Background Patients with complicated S. aureus bacteremia
(SaB) require a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) to rule out
endocarditis. Risks of TEE may exceed benefits in patients with a low
pretest probability of endocarditis. Given our prior findings that
endovascular bacterial burden drives elevated serum IL-10
concentrations, we hypothesize that time to positive blood culture and
IL-10 serum concentrations may be used to risk stratify patients for
selection of TEE. We compared time to positive blood culture and serum
IL-10 in patients with negative and positive TEE. Methods Patients
with SaB were included if they had a diagnosis of primary,
endovascular infection source of bacteremia identified by an
infectious diseases consult team and a TEE performed. A retrospective
chart review was done to identify the time to positivity (hours) of
patient blood cultures grown aerobically or anaerobically and TEE
results. Sera collected at clinical presentation of these patients
were tested for biomarkers IL-10 and IL-1β. Mann–Whitney U test
compared the data between the two groups. Results This study included
66 patients with SaB: 17 with negative TEE and 49 with positive TEE.
Patients with a positive TEE confirming endocarditis had a faster time
to positive blood cultures compared with patients with negative TEE (P
= 0.031; figure). IL-10 serum concentrations were significantly higher
in patients with positive TEE (26.2 pg/mL) vs. negative TEE (14.39
pg/mL). Time-to-positivity in blood culture was linearly associated
serum IL-10 concentrations (P = 0.044; figure). Serum IL-1β
concentrations were also higher in TEE positive vs. TEE negative
patients (32.1 vs. 14.7 pg/mL, P = 0.067) Conclusion These data lend
further evidence to link high endovascular bacterial burden (measured
by shorter time to positive blood culture) and serum IL-10
concentrations. As anticipated, patients with positive TEE had
significantly shorter time to blood culture positivity and higher
IL-10 serum concentrations than those with negative TEE. With further
study on a larger number of patients, time to positive blood cultures
and serum biomarkers like IL-10 may be used to risk stratify patients
for performance of TEE, as well as to select antimicrobial therapy and
to adjust treatment duration. Disclosures All authors: No reported

AB  - Abstract Background Gram-negative bloodstream infections are one of
the leading causes of death in the United States. A select number of
studies have been conducted evaluating various treatment durations;
however, none have specifically focused on urinary sources. The
purpose of this study was to compare the effect of short vs. long
course of antimicrobial therapy on clinical and microbiological
outcomes for urinary tract-associated gram-negative bacteremia (GNB).
Methods This was a single-center, retrospective review from January
2016 to October 2018. Subjects were screened using a report of all
positive GNB cultures. Hospitalized patients ≥18 years of age were
included if they had a bacteremia from a urinary source and received
an intravenous or a highly bioavailable oral agent for ≥7 days.
Patients were excluded due to pregnancy, incarceration, inappropriate
definitive therapy, polymicrobial bacteremia, unaddressed source
control issues, or death during the treatment course. Short course
(SC) was defined as 7–10 days, while long course (LC) was defined as
>10 days. The primary composite outcome of treatment failure included
both 30-day all-cause mortality and 90-day recurrence. Secondary
outcomes included 30-day re-admission, 90-day mortality, resistance
development, and C. difficile infection. Results A total of 207
patients were included: 45 patients received SC and 162 received LC.
Both groups were similar at baseline in terms of comorbidities,
intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and vasopressor initiation. No
statistically significant difference in the primary composite endpoint
was observed: 2/45 (4.4%) SC vs. LC 10/162 (6.2%), P = 0.66. There was
also no difference in other secondary outcomes. Conclusion Consistent
with prior studies, we were unable to find a significant difference in
clinical failure rates between SC vs. LC for treatment of urinary
tract-associated GNB. Generalizability to more complicated cases
including those with inadequate source control may be limited;
however, these data add to the body of literature supporting the use
of shorter antibiotic durations. Disclosures All authors: No reported

AB  - Abstract Background Gram-negative pathogens take 24–72 hours to be
identified (ID) and for antimicrobial susceptibilities (AS) to be
obtained from blood cultures. Rapid molecular diagnostic tests (RDT)
can shorten time to pathogen identification and antibiotic
optimization. We compared our current processes with the predicted
impact of an RDT system, to assist with an institutional decision to
invest in RDT. The Accelerate PhenoTest™ BC Kit, which provides
pathogen ID within 90 minutes of positive growth and AST within 7
hours, was selected as an example of a commercially available system
for study purposes. Methods A retrospective review of adult patients
between January 2016 and September 2017 with ≥1 positive blood culture
with a Gram-negative organism detectable by the RDT system was
conducted. Subject characteristics and organisms identified were
recorded. Primary endpoints of the study were potential change in
times to ID and AS with use of RDT. Standard laboratory procedures
were used for ID and AS (pre-intervention period). The same subject
population was used to calculate a theoretical time to ID and AS if
RDT were used (modeled post-intervention). Patients were excluded if
they expired or were discharged prior to culture results, on
hemodialysis, were an outpatient at the time of + culture, or if time
of ID or AS was not reported in the electronic record. Results A total
of 156 subjects met inclusion criteria. The most common organisms
isolated were E. coli (45%) and K. pneumoniae (22%). The
pre-intervention mean time to ID and AS in the medical record were
identical at 56 hours (using VITEK®). The mean times to effective
(covering) and optimal (targeted/consolidated) therapy for the
pre-intervention group were 8 and 75 hours, respectively. For the
modeled post-intervention period, RDT could decrease time to ID by 54
hours (95% CI: 50.5–59.1, P < 0.001) and AS by 49 hours (95% CI:
45.1–53.5, P < 0.001). Conclusion Time to optimal therapy of
Gram-negative bloodstream infections at our facility was ~3 days
(within a day of final organism ID and AS). This demonstrates
excellent communication protocols between our microbiology and
clinical departments, suggesting that our modeled benefit to RDT for
organism ID and AS has good potential to be translated into clinical
benefits. Disclosures All authors: No reported disclosures.

AB  - Objectives: Concern for late detection of bacterial pathogens is a
barrier to early de-escalation efforts. The purpose of this study was
to assess blood, respiratory and urine culture results at 72 h to test
the hypothesis that early negative culture results have a clinically
meaningful negative predictive value. Methods: We retrospectively
reviewed all patients admitted to the medical intensive care unit
between March 2012 and July 2018 with blood cultures obtained. Blood,
respiratory and urine culture results were assessed for time to
positivity, defined as the time between culture collection and
preliminary species identification. The primary outcome was the
negative predictive value of negative blood culture results at 72 h.
Secondary outcomes included sensitivity, specificity, positive
predictive value and negative predictive value of blood, respiratory
and urine culture results. Results: The analysis included 1567 blood,
514 respiratory and 1059 urine cultures. Of the blood, respiratory and
urine cultures ultimately positive, 90.3%, 76.2% and 90.4% were
positive at 72 h. The negative predictive value of negative 72-h
blood, respiratory and urine cultures were 0.99, 0.82 and 0.97,
respectively. Antibiotic de-escalation had good specificity, positive
predictive value and negative predictive value for finalized negative
cultures. Conclusion: Negative blood and urine culture results at 72 h
had a high negative predictive value. These findings have important
ramifications for antimicrobial stewardship efforts and support
protocolized re-evaluation of empiric antibiotic therapy at 72 h.
Caution should be used in patients with clinically suspected
pneumonia, since negative respiratory culture results at 72 h were
weakly predictive of finalized negative cultures.

AB  - Abstract Background The relationship between the number of positive
blood cultures (NPBCs) and clinical outcomes has not been
well-studied. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of
NPBCs (one set or two) on clinical outcomes. Methods We conducted a
retrospective study comparing the clinical features of two sets of
positive blood cultures (NPBCs=2) and one set of positive blood
culture (NPBCs=1) in adult patients with bacteremia and fungemia from
2004 to 2021 at a tertiary hospital in Tokyo, Japan. We focused on
four pathogens commonly encountered in clinical practice, including
Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Streptococci, gram-negative rods
(GNR) (Enterobacterales and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and Candida
species, as the true causative pathogens in bacteremia and fungemia.
The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality, and secondary outcomes
were ICU admission and use of vasopressor drugs. Results In univariate
analysis, NPBCs=2 for S. aureus was associated with vasopressor use,
and NPBCs=2 for Streptococci was linked to a higher rate of ICU
admission. However, these differences were not significant in
multivariate analysis. Interestingly, NPBCs=2 for S. aureus had a
positive impact on in-hospital mortality compared with NPBCs=1 (OR
0.574, 95%CI 0.376–0.877, p < 0.05). NPBCs for Candida species did not
affect clinical outcomes. Furthermore, NPBCs=2 for GNR was associated
with vasopressor use (OR 1.62, 95%CI 1.27–2.07, p < 0.05) in both
univariate and multivariate analysis. We performed logistic regression
analysis using the five items with the highest clinical significance:
NPBCs=2, serum Cr > 1.2 mg/dL, Hb < 12 g/dL, heart rate > 90
beats/min, and platelet count < 150,000/μL. Based on the β
coefficient, we assigned scores to each item and created a STAT-2 (S:
Serum Cr, T: Thrombocytopenia, A: Anemia, T: Tachycardia, 2: NPBCs=2)
score for the use of hypertensive drugs for GNR. The receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curve for the STAT-2 score with a
cutoff of 6 points or higher had an area under the curve (AUC) of
0.763. The specificity was 90.8%, with a positive likelihood ratio of
4.13 (95% CI 3.40-5.02). Conclusion Our study suggests that NPBCs can
predict clinical outcomes in patients with certain pathogenic
infections. Disclosures All Authors: No reported disclosures

AB  - OBJECTIVES

To investigate the prognostic effects of delayed administration of
appropriate antimicrobial therapy (AAT) in older persons experiencing
bacteremia with and without initial sepsis syndrome, respectively.

DESIGN

A 4-year multicenter cohort study.

SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS

Older people (≥65 years of age) with community-onset bacteremia in the
emergency department (ED) of 3 participating hospitals.

METHODS

Clinical data were retrospectively collected and causative
microorganisms were prospectively collected for susceptibilities to
determine the period of delayed AAT for each bacteremia episode.
Sepsis was defined based on the Sepsis-3 criteria. A multivariable
regression model was used to investigate the prognostic effects of
delayed AAT, after adjusting independent determinants of 30-day
mortality.

RESULTS

Of the total 2357 patients, their median (interquartile range) age was
78 (72-84) years and septic patients accounted for 48.4% (1140
patients) of the overall patients. Compared with nonseptic patients,
septic individuals exhibited the shorter period of delayed AAT
(median, 2.0 vs 2.5 hours; P < .001), longer hospitalization (median,
11 vs 9 days; P < .001), and higher crude mortality rates at 15 (28.9%
vs 2.1%; P < .001) and 30 days (34.6% vs 4.0%; P < .001). In
multivariable regression analyses, each hour of delayed AAT resulted
in average increases in the 30-day crude mortality rates of 0.38%
[adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 1.0038; P < .001), 0.42% (AOR 1.0042; P <
.001), and 0.31% (AOR 1.0031; P = .04) among overall, septic, and
nonseptic patients, respectively.

CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS

For older persons with community-onset bacteremia, irrespective of
whether or not patients experiencing initial sepsis presentations, the
prognostic impacts of delayed AAT have been evidenced. Notably,
because of the longer period of delayed AAT in patients without
fulfilling the Sepsis-3, adopting a stricter sepsis definition and/or
early bacteremia predictor to avoid delayed AAT and unfavorable
prognoses in patients with bacteremia is necessary.

AB  - OBJECTIVES

The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and prognostic
impact of communicating microbiological information in real time in
adult patients with a bloodstream infection.

METHODS

We have retrospectively reviewed 6,225 clinical episodes of
bacteraemia in a 700-bed tertiary teaching hospital from January 2013
to December 2019. Bacteraemia-associated mortality was compared
between periods where blood culture result was relayed to the
infectious disease specialist [IDS] in real time and those periods
where information was delayed to the following morning. An adjusted
logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the impact of
information availability using mortality at 30 days as the main
outcome of the study.

RESULTS

The initial analysis (all microorganisms included) did not show an
association of mortality and information delay to the IDS (OR 1.18;
95%CI: 0.99-1.42). However, information delay of BSI caused by
fast-growing microorganisms (like Enterobacterales) was associated
with a significant increase in the odds of death at 30 days both in
the univariate (OR 1.76; 95%CI: 1.30-2.38) and in the multivariate
analysis (OR 2.22; 95%CI: 1.50-3.30). Similar results were found with
mortality at 14 days and at 7 days in the univariate analysis (OR:
1.54; 95%CI:1.08-2.20 and OR.1.56; 95%CI: 1.03-2.37, respectively) and
the multivariate analysis (OR: 2.05; 95%CI:1.27-3.32 and OR:1.92;
95%CI:1.09-3.40, respectively).

CONCLUSIONS

Information delivered in real time has prognostic relevance and it is
likely to improve survival of patients with documented bloodstream
infection. Future studies should address the prognostic impact of
adequate resource allocation (microbiologist/IDS with 24/7 coverage)
in bloodstream infections.

can provide antimicrobial susceptibility results within 7 h of a
positive culture and may more rapidly optimize therapy. The primary
objective of this study was to evaluate the hypothetical impact of ACC
on time to effective therapy (TTET) and time to definitive therapy
(TTDT) among patients with BSI due to resistant GN pathogens. ACC was
performed on resistant GN BSI isolates, and results were not available
to clinicians in real time. A potential benefit of having ACC on TTET
or TTDT was determined if modifications to antimicrobial regimens
could have been made sooner with ACC. Comparisons on the impact of ACC
in the presence or absence of testing by the Verigene Gram-negative
blood culture test (Verigene GN-BC) were performed. Sixty-one patients
with resistant GN BSI were evaluated. The median actual TTET and TTDT
in the cohort were 25.9 h (interquartile range [IQR], 18.5, 42.1) and
47.6 h (IQR, 24.9, 79.6), respectively. Almost half of the patients
had potential improvement in TTET and/or TTDT with ACC. In patients
who would have had a benefit the median potential decreases in TTET
and TTDT were 16.6 h (IQR, 5.5 to 30.6) and 29.8 h (IQR, 13.6 to 43),
respectively. The largest potential improvements were seen in patients
for whom Verigene results were not available. In conclusion, among
patients with resistant GN BSI in a setting where other rapid
diagnostic technologies are utilized, ACC results could have further
improved TTET and TTDT.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objective. To determine the diagnostic performance of blood
culture positivity times for distinguishing true bacteremia from
contaminants in the automated “BACT/ALERT®” system. Materials and
methods. A cross-sectional, diagnostic test-type study was conducted
from a database of blood culture samples processed between January
2016 and August 2021. All blood culture samples from patients with
suspected bacteremia were included; blood culture samples were entered
into the “BACT/ALERT®” system to differentiate true bacteremia from
contaminants. Results. We obtained 33,951 blood cultures samples, of
which 3875 were positive. Of the total number of positive blood
cultures, 75.2% (n=2913) were true bacteremia and 24.8% (n=962) were
contaminants. The median time to positivity in blood cultures with
true bacteremia was significantly shorter (16.3 hours; IQR: 11.2 -
24.9) than the median time to positivity of blood cultures with
contaminants (22.5 hours; IQR: 18.4 - 31.8; p<0.001). The positivity
time showed the capacity to differentiate true bacteremia from
contaminants, with an AUC-ROC of 0.73 (95%CI: 0.71 - 0.75), with 85%
and 63% sensitivity and specificity respectively for the diagnosis of
contaminants when the positivity time exceeds 16.5 hours. The use of
antibiotics prior to sampling delayed the time to positivity, while
having fever before sampling shortened the time to positivity.
Conclusions. Our results show good diagnostic performance of blood
culture positivity times to differentiate true bacteremia from
contaminants using the “BACT/ALERT®” system when the positivity time
was longer than 16.5 hours.

AB  - Abstract Background Prompt identification of an etiologic pathogen is
vital for the optimal management of bloodstream infections (BSIs).
Rapid diagnostic testing (RDT) has implications for the treatment of
BSIs, particularly for cases with resistant Gram-negative (GN)
organisms. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of
Verigene’s Gram-negative blood culture nucleic acid test (BC-GN), in
conjunction with a pharmacy-driven antimicrobial stewardship team
(AST), on time to antimicrobial optimization in GN BSIs. Methods This
was a retrospective pre- and post-intervention study at a 950-bed
community hospital in South Texas. Clinical isolates from adult
patients with GN BSIs were included across two study periods: from
July 1, 2012 to July 31, 2014 in the pre-intervention group (prior to
BC-GN with AST) and from July 1, 2015 to July 31, 2017 in the
post-intervention group (after BC-GN with AST). RDT results were
transmitted to pharmacy-managed surveillance software for AST review
and intervention. The primary outcome was time to optimal therapy
(TOT) from initial culture positivity. Secondary outcomes included TOT
based on organism and clinical pharmacy staffing hours, hospital
length of stay, and all-cause mortality. Results Among 324 patients
screened with a first episode of GN BSI, 121 and 119 patients were
included in the pre- and post-intervention groups, respectively. Apart
from intensive care unit admission at the time of culture collection,
there were no significant differences in baseline characteristics
between the two groups. The post-intervention group had a
significantly shorter TOT (60.2 ± 36.0 hours vs. 29.0 ± 24.0 hours, P
< 0.001). Notably, time to escalation for patients with
third-generation cephalosporin-resistant isolates was significantly
shorter in the post-intervention group (48 ± 36.0 hours vs. 19.2 ±
16.8 hours, P < 0.01). In the post-intervention group, TOT was
significantly shorter during fully staffed clinical pharmacy hours vs.
reduced clinical pharmacy staff hours (18.48 ± 31.2 hours vs. 31.44 ±
38.4 hours, P = 0.014). No differences were seen in length of stay or
all-cause mortality. Conclusion The implementation of RDT with a
pharmacy-driven AST substantially decreased TOT for GN BSIs. This
study also highlights the positive impact of clinical pharmacy staff
on shorter TOTs. Disclosures All authors: No reported disclosures.

AB  - BACKGROUND

The quick sequential organ failure assessment (qSOFA) score predicts
mortality in patients with suspected infection. We sought to
understand how well qSOFA and the Systemic Inflammatory Response
Syndrome (SIRS) criteria predict gram negative bacteraemia.

METHODS

We prospectively evaluated 99 patients with gram negative bloodstream
infection from a single tertiary centre. We assessed the utility of
SIRS and qSOFA for their rate of positivity and association with early
delivery of antibiotics (<3 h).

RESULTS

The SIRS criteria had the highest positivity rate amongst patients
with gram negative bacteraemia (85%) compared to the qSOFA criteria
(25%) on the day of first positive culture. Positive SIRS criteria was
the only score associated with delivery of antibiotics within 3 h
(Relative risk 3.5, 95% Confidence interval 1.3 to 12.5, p = < 0.02).

CONCLUSION

In patients with gram negative bloodstream infection SIRS criteria was
the most common positive risk score and had a higher association with
early delivery of antibiotics when compared to qSOFA.

AB  - Abstract Objective: Gram-positive bacilli represent a diverse species
of bacteria that range from commensal flora to pathogens implicated in
severe and life-threatening infection. Following the isolation of
Gram-positive bacilli from blood cultures, the time to species
identification may take upward of 24 hours, leaving clinicians to
conjecture whether they may represent a contaminant (inadvertent
inoculation of commensal flora) or pathogenic organism. In this study,
we sought to identify patient variables that could help predict the
isolation of contaminant versus pathogenic Gram-positive bacilli from
blood cultures. Design: Retrospective cohort study. Settings: One
quaternary academic medical center affiliated with the University of
Toronto. Patients: Adult inpatients were admitted to hospital over a
5-year period (May 2014 to December 2019). Methods: A total of 260
unique Gram-positive bacilli blood culture results from adult
inpatients were reviewed and analyzed in both a univariable and
multivariable model. Results: Malignancy (aOR 2.78, 95% CI 1.33–5.91,
p = 0.007), point increments in the Quick Sepsis Related Organ Failure
Assessment score for sepsis (aOR 2.25, 95% CI 1.50–3.47, p < 0.001),
peptic ulcer disease (aOR 5.63, 95% CI 1.43–21.0, p = 0.01), and the
receipt of immunosuppression prior to a blood culture draw (aOR 3.80,
95% CI 1.86–8.01, p < 0.001) were associated with an increased
likelihood of speciating pathogenic Gram-positive bacilli from blood
cultures such as Clostridium species and Listeria monocytogenes.
Conclusion: Such predictors can help supplement a clinician’s
assessment on determining when empirical therapy is indicated when
faced with Gram-positive bacilli from blood cultures and may direct
future stewardship interventions for responsible antimicrobial
prescribing.

AB  - OBJECTIVE

To determine the outcomes of patients discharged from the emergency
department (ED) with a bloodstream infection (BSI) and how these
outcomes are influenced by antibiotic treatment.

METHOD

We identified every BSI in adult patients discharged from our ED to
the community between July 1, 2002, and March 31, 2011. The medical
records of all cases were reviewed to determine antibiotic treatment
in the ED and at discharge. Microorganism sensitivities were used to
determine whether antibiotics were appropriate. These data were linked
to population-based administrative data to determine specific patient
outcomes within the subsequent 2-week period: death, urgent
hospitalization, or an unplanned return to the ED.

RESULTS

A total of 480 adults with BSI were identified (1.49 cases per 1,000
adults discharged from the department). Compared to controls (321,048
patients), BSI patients had a significantly higher risk of urgent
hospitalization (adjusted OR 2.1 [95% CI 1.6-2.8]) and unplanned
return to the ED (adjusted OR 4.1 [95% CI 3.3-4.9]). Outcome risk was
significantly lowered in BSI patients who received appropriate
antibiotics in the ED and at discharge. In elderly patients, the risk
of urgent hospitalization increased significantly as the time to
appropriate antibiotics was delayed.

CONCLUSIONS

BSI patients discharged from the ED have a significantly increased
risk of urgent hospitalization and unplanned return to the ED in the
subsequent 2 weeks. These risks decrease significantly with the timely
provision of appropriate antibiotics. Our results support the
aggressive use of measures ensuring that such patients receive
appropriate antibiotics as soon as possible.

AB  - Given the overall prevalence and poor prognosis of Staphylococcus
aureus bloodstream infections (BSIs), the study of treatment
strategies to improve patient outcomes is important. The aim of this
study was to conduct a multifaceted antibiotic treatment analysis of
methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) BSI and to characterise optimal
early antibiotic therapy (within the first 7 days of drawing the index
blood culture) for this serious infection. Antibiotic selection was
categorised as optimal targeted (intravenous cloxacillin or
cefazolin), optimal broad (piperacillin/tazobactam or meropenem),
adequate (vancomycin) or inadequate (other antibiotics or oral
therapy). A TSE (timing, selection, exposure) score was developed to
comprehensively characterise early antibiotic therapy, where higher
points corresponded to prompt initiation, optimal antibiotic selection
and longer exposure (duration). Amongst 71 cases of complicated
MSSA-BSI, end-of-treatment (EOT) response (i.e. clinical cure) was
improved when at least adequate antibiotic therapy was initiated
within 24 h [71.7% (33/46) vs. 48.0% (12/25); P = 0.047]. Clinical
cure was also more likely when therapy included ≥4 days of optimal
targeted antibiotics within the first 7 days [74.4% (29/39) vs. 50.0%
(16/32); P = 0.03]. The TSE score was an informative index of early
antibiotic therapy, with EOT cure documented in 72.0% (36/50) compared
with 42.9% (9/21) of cases with scores above and below 15.2,
respectively (P = 0.02). In multivariable analysis, lower Charlson
comorbidity index, presence of BSI on admission, and optimising early
antibiotic therapy, as described above, were associated with clinical
cure in patients with MSSA-BSI.

AB  - OBJECTIVE

The aim of this study was to determine the usefulness of oxidase test
and time-to-positivity (TTP) in aerobic and anaerobic blood culture
vials to detect the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in patients
with Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) bacteraemia.

METHODS

TTP was recorded for each aerobic and anaerobic blood culture vial of
monomicrobial bacteraemia due to GNB. Oxidase test was performed in a
pellet of the centrifuged content of the positive blood culture. An
algorithm was developed in order to perform the oxidase test
efficiently taking into account TTP and type of vial.

RESULTS

A total of 341 episodes of GNB bacteraemia were analysed. Sensitivity,
specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value
of the oxidase test performed on positive vials with GNB to predict P.
aeruginosa were 95%, 99%, 91%, and 99%, respectively. When growth was
first or exclusively detected in anaerobic vials, P. aeruginosa was
never identified hence the performance of the oxidase test could be
avoided. When growth was only or first detected in aerobic vials, a
TTP≥8h predicted P. aeruginosa in 37% or cases (63 of 169), therefore
oxidase test is highly recommended.

CONCLUSIONS

Oxidase test performed onto positive blood culture vials previously
selected by TTP and type of vials is an easy and inexpensive way to
predict P. aeruginosa. In most cases, this can lead to optimization of
treatment in less than 24 hours.

AB  - A recently developed, automated blood culture system and medium
improve the time-to-positivity (TTP) for bacteremia. However, there
have thus far been no genus-level analyses using this novel system. We
evaluated and compared the changes in blood culture TTP between two
systems: BacT/Alert 3D with a blood culture medium containing
activated charcoal versus the more recent BacT/Alert Virtuo with a
blood culture medium containing polymeric beads. This before-and-after
study included blood cultures collected between July 2010 and April
2014 (3D, activated charcoal) and between July 2015 and April 2018
(Virtuo, polymeric beads). A total of 554,732 blood cultures were
included, 267,935 (48.30%) during the first period and 286,797
(51.70%) during the second period. Overall, 55,611 (10.02%) tested
positive for at least one microorganism. The incubation of the blood
culture medium in the Virtuo system was associated with reduced TTP
for the most prevalent bacteria, those representing 91.72% (n=51,006)
of all the positive blood cultures. The median TTP was reduced by 0.99
h for Staphylococcus, Enterococcus, Streptococcus, Pseudomonadales,
and most of the genera within the order Enterobacterales (except the
family Morganellaceae). However, strictly anaerobic bacteria belonging
to the genus Bacteroides, representing 0.85% (n=474) of all positive
blood cultures, were detected 4.53 h later using the Virtuo system.
Virtuo was associated with a shorter TTP for most bacteria, but this
improvement was heterogeneous to the genus level.

AB  - Bacteremia is associated with high morbidity and mortality, which
contribute substantially to health care costs. A beneficial influence
of appropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy (EAT) on patient
outcome is evidenced; However, the evidence highlighting a comparison
of clinical manifestations and of the effects of inappropriate EAT
between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteremia is insufficient. In
a retrospective 6-year cohort study, the total 2053 adults
(Gram-positive, 566; Gram-negative 1487) presenting with
community-onset monomicrobial aerobes bacteremia were recruited.
Inappropriate EAT was defined as the first dose of an appropriate
antimicrobial agent not being administered within the first 24 h after
blood cultures were drawn. Although the bacteremia severity (a Pitt
bacteremia score) at onset, comorbidity severity (the McCabe-Johnson
classification), and 28-day mortality rate were similar in the two
groups. Furthermore, after adjustment of independent predictors of
28-day mortality respectively recognized by the multivariate
regression model in Gram-negative and Gram-positive groups, the
Kaplan-Meier curve and Cox regression analysis revealed a significant
difference (adjust odds ratio [AOR], 2.68; P < 0.001) between
appropriate and inappropriate EAT in the Gram-negative group, but not
in the Gram-positive group (AOR, 1.54; P = 0.06). Conclusively,
patients with Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteremia exhibited the
similar presentation in bacteremia severity, but a greater impact of
inappropriate EAT on survival of patients with Gram-negative aerobe
bacteremia was evidenced.

AB  - PURPOSE

To determine the risk factors on hospital mortality in patients with
community-acquired severe sepsis and septic shock in the first 24
hours after admission to the intensive care unit.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The study was prospective, observational, single-centre and included
adult patients with community-acquired severe sepsis and septic shock.
Demographics, clinical, laboratory and microbiological data were
recorded. The main outcome measure was hospital mortality.

RESULTS

During the study period, 184 patients were included. The overall
mortality rate was 51.6%, 44.4% with severe sepsis and 71.4% in
patients with septic shock. The lung was the most common site of
infection (65.8%) and respiratory failure was the most common organ
failure (54.9%). Multivariate analysis identified four independent
risk factors for mortality in patients with severe sepsis and septic
shock: three or more organ dysfunctions (OR, 3.212; 95% CI,
1.585-6.506; p<0.001), acute respiratory failure (OR, 2.649 95% CI,
1.327-5.287; p=0.006), positive blood culture (OR, 2.708; 95% CI,
1.289-5.689; p=0.009) and chronic heart failure (OR, 2.112; 95% CI,
1.036-4.308; p=0.040).

CONCLUSION

Our results highlight the importance of three or more organ
dys-functions, acute respiratory failure, positive blood culture and
chronic heart failure as independent risk factors for mortality in the
first 24 hours after admission in patients with severe sepsis and
septic shock. This will benefit the early identification of patients
at high risk for poor outcomes that contributes to intensive
management and appropriate treatment interventions.

AB  - ABSTRACT In this secondary analysis of 386 subjects with Gram-negative
bacteremia enrolled in the RAPIDS GN trial, rapid antibiotic
susceptibility testing had a greater benefit on the management of
bacteremia caused by antibiotic-resistant compared to
antibiotic-susceptible isolates, especially for Escherichia coli,
Klebsiella species, and Proteus species. IMPORTANCE Rapid blood
culture diagnostics are costly, and their use has not demonstrated
clear clinical benefit for patients with Gram-negative sepsis,
possibly because prior trials did not enroll sufficient numbers of
patients with antibiotic-resistant infections. This analysis of
patients with sepsis previously enrolled in a randomized controlled
clinical trial demonstrates that rapid susceptibility testing of
bacteria from blood cultures had the greatest impact for patients with
antibiotic-resistant infections. Specifically, after rapid testing
results were reported, patients infected with resistant bacteria
received appropriate antibiotic therapy more quickly than patients
with susceptible bacteria. These findings highlight the need to
evaluate blood culture diagnostics in areas with high antibiotic
resistance where these diagnostics are likely to have the greatest
impact. Rapid blood culture diagnostics are costly, and their use has

AB  - Background: The relationship between vegetation characteristics in
Staphylococcus aureus infective endocarditis (IE) and blood culture
time to positivity (TTP) has not been investigated. This study
evaluates the correlation between vegetation length and TTP in
patients with S. aureus IE. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was
conducted that included 164 definite cases S. aureus IE. Vegetation
length was determined by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), and
TTP was measured in hours from the initial time of blood culture
incubation to positivity. Correlations between vegetation
characteristics and TTP were analyzed using Spearman’s rank
correlation coefficient. Results: A modest but statistically
significant negative correlation was observed between vegetation
length and TTP (Spearman ρ = −0.18, p = 0.020), suggesting that larger
vegetations were associated with shorter TTP. No significant
correlations were found for other vegetation characteristics (e.g.,
vegetation mobility, location, or number) and TTP. Conclusions: Larger
vegetation size in S. aureus IE was associated with shorter TTP. These
findings highlight the importance of vegetation size in the
pathophysiology of S. aureus IE and its role in bacteremia dynamics.

AB  - Objective To investigate the prognostic value of time to
positivity(TTP) of blood culture in patients with bloodstream
infection(BSI) caused by Escherichia coli(E. coli). Methods A total of
174 adult inpatients,who had blood culture and from whom E. coli were
isolated from 2008 to 2012,were divided,taking P 25(7. 13 h) of TTP as
cutoff point,into groups low-TTP(n = 43),high-TTP(n = 131). The
clinical features,prognoses were compared between 2 groups. Results
There was no significant difference in proportion of elderly
patients,that of males,incidence of hospital-acquired
infection,proportion of poor basic state,rate of strain-produced
extended-spectrum β-lactamase(ESBL),primary infection foci,infection
associated risk factors between 2 groups(P 0. 05). The incidences of
severe sepsis and septic shock,mortality rate were higher in low-TTP
group than in high-TTP group(P 0. 05). Logistic regression analysis
showed that OR of low-TTP predicting occurrence of severe sepsis and
septic shock was 6. 618 〔95% CI(3. 036,14. 429),P 0. 001〕,and that
predicting hospital death was 4. 159 〔95% CI(1. 623,0. 657),P = 0.
003〕. ROC curves showed that TTP≤9. 72 h was the best cut-off point
predicting occurrence of severe sepsis and septic shock(AUC = 0.
792),and that TTP≤9. 38 h was the best cut-off point predicting
hospital death(AUC = 0. 708). Conclusion The value of low TTP
predicting occurrence of severe sepsis and septic shock,hospital death
is medium in BSI patients caused by E. coli,which provides important
warning information of early bacteremia uneasy to be detected
clinically.

AB  - Abstract This study evaluated the determinants of mortality and the T
cell immune response in patients with persistent Staphylococcus aureus
bacteremia (SAB). This was a prospective cohort study and patients
with confirmed SAB were enrolled from 2008 to 2020. We compared
clinical, microbiological, and genotypic features between surviving
and deceased patients with persistent SAB. The concentrations of
cytokines and the proportions of IFN-γ secreting CD4 + T cells were
measured serially during the bacteremia period. Of the 1760 patients,
242 had persistent bacteremia (PB), and 49 PB patients died within 30
days. In the multivariate analysis, the APACHE II score and female sex
were independently associated with 30 days mortality. The level of
IL-10 was significantly increased in the plasma of patients with a
high Pitt bacteremia score and those who died within 12 weeks from the
index day. The proportion of IFN-γ-secreting CD4 + T cells were the
highest just before the positive-to-negative conversion of blood
cultures in patients with a low Pitt bacteremia score and those who
survived for 12 weeks. The level of IL-10 is correlated with clinical
outcomes in PB patients. IFN-γ secreting CD4 + T cells might play a
pivotal role in SAB PB.

Stewardship for Patients with Bloodstream Infections: Accelerate
PhenoTest™ BC Kit (AXDX) Registry Study were analysed to determine the
impact of rapid organism identification and antimicrobial
susceptibility testing (AST) for Gram-positive bacteraemia. Patients
and methods This multicentre, quasi-experimental study evaluated
clinical and antimicrobial stewardship metrics following the
implementation of AXDX. Data from hospitalized patients with
bacteraemia were compared between groups, one that underwent testing
on AXDX (post-AXDX) and one that underwent traditional identification
and AST (pre-AXDX). An analysis of patients with Gram-positive
bacteraemia was performed. The primary outcome was time to optimal
therapy (TTOT). Secondary outcomes included time to first antibiotic
modification (overall and Gram-positive), duration of unnecessary MRSA
coverage, incidence of adverse events, length of stay and mortality.
Results A total of 219 (109 pre-AXDX, 110 post-AXDX) patients with
Gram-positive bacteraemia were included. Median TTOT was 36.3 h (IQR,
16.9–56.7) in the pre-AXDX group and 20.4 h (IQR, 7.5–36.7) in the
post-AXDX group (P = 0.01). Compared with pre-AXDX, median time to
first antibiotic modification (29.1 versus 15.9 h; P = 0.002), time to
first Gram-positive antibiotic modification (33.2 versus 17.2 h;
P = 0.003) and median duration of unnecessary MRSA coverage (58.4
versus 29.7 h; P = 0.04) were reduced post-AXDX. A trend towards
decreased acute kidney injury (24% versus 13%; P = 0.06) was observed
in the post-AXDX group. Groups did not differ in other secondary
outcomes. Conclusions Implementation of AXDX testing for patients with
Gram-positive bacteraemia shortened the TTOT and reduced unnecessary
antibiotic exposure due to faster antibiotic modifications.

AB  - ABSTRACT The differential time to positivity (DTTP) technique is the
recommended conservative procedure to diagnose catheter-related
bloodstream infection (C-RBSI). However, its reliability and accuracy
remain under debate. Therefore, we aimed to compare the DTTP technique
feasibility to detect C-RBSI compared to the catheter culture (CC)
method. We conducted a 9-month retrospective study including
bacteremic episodes in which both DTTP blood cultures (BC) and CC were
obtained. We analyzed the diagnostic validity of the DTTP technique
for detecting C-RBSI compared to the gold standard (C-RBSI with CC),
along with patient clinical data. We included 37 episodes of C-RBSI
where both DTTP BC and CC were obtained. C-RBSI was confirmed by both
techniques in only 13 episodes (35.1%), whereas in 11 (29.7%) and 13
(35.1%), only DTTP BC or DTTP BC with CC (with a difference between
catheter lumen and peripheral BC growth of <2 hours) was positive,
respectively. Therefore, the validity values of the DTTP technique for
predicting C-RBSI were as follows: sensitivity, 50.0%; specificity,
71.8%; positive predictive value, 54.2%; and negative predictive
value, 68.3%. The distribution of microorganisms was similar among the
three groups. All patients in whom colonization was not demonstrated
by CC (n = 11) had been receiving antibiotics before catheter
withdrawal. DTTP is a conservative technique that might help to
diagnose C-RBSI mostly in situations where catheter removal cannot be
achieved. However, it should be interpreted with caution and never be
used to rule out C-RBSI. CC before starting antimicrobial therapy
remains the most reliable method to diagnose and confirm an episode of
C-RBSI. IMPORTANCE We try to clarify the reliability of the
differential time to positivity technique to predict C-RBSI. It may be
interpreted with caution and considering clinical signs, as some
C-RBSI can be misdiagnosed. We try to clarify the reliability of the

AB  - INTRODUCTION

Among hospital-acquired infections, bacteremia is one of the leading
causes of mortality worldwide, especially among intensive care unit
patients, where it is more frequent. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of
the most aggressive agents causing bacteremia.

OBJECTIVE

To evaluate the association between initial antimicrobial therapy and
hospital mortality in these patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

A multicenter and retrospective cohort study was conducted between
2005 and 2008. Antimicrobial therapy was considered adequate if it
included at least one intravenous antibiotic to which the P.
aeruginosa isolate was susceptible in vitro, was administered at the
recommended dose and frequency for bacteremia, and initiated within
the first 48 hours from diagnosis. The main outcome was 30-day
hospital mortality. Patients were paired according to exposure level
using propensity score matching, and then a parametric survival model
was fitted.

RESULTS

One hundred and sixty four patients were included. Median age and the
APACHE II score were 56 and 13, respectively. The source of bacteremia
was identified in 68.3 % of cases, the respiratory tract being the
most frequent. Forty-four percent of patients received inadequate
therapy, with bacterial resistance as the main associated variable.
The incidence of severe sepsis, septic shock, multiple organ failure
and death within the first 30 days was 67.7, 50, 41.5 and 43.9%,
respectively. Adequate therapy was associated with a longer time to
the event (adjusted time ratio, 2.95, 95% CI, 1.63 to 5.33).

CONCLUSION

Adequate initial antimicrobial therapy is a protective factor against
hospital mortality in patients with P. aeruginosa bacteremia.

AB  - INTRODUCTION

Bacteremia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized
patients. Predictors of mortality are critical for the management and
survival of hospitalized patients. The objective of this study was to
determine the factors related to blood culture positivity and the risk
factors for mortality in patients whose blood cultures were collected.

METHODS

A prospective 2-cohort study (derivation with 784 patients and
validation with 380 patients) based on the Pitt bacteremia score for
all patients undergoing blood culture collection. The score was
obtained from multivariate analysis. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve
of the cohort derivation and the cohort validation groups was
calculated, and the difference was assessed using a log-rank test.
Mortality-related factors were older age, extended
hospitalization, > 10% of immature cells in the leukogram, lower mean
blood pressure, elevated heart rate, elevated WBC count, and elevated
respiratory rate. These continuous variables were dichotomized
according to their significance level, and a cut-off limit was
created.

RESULTS

The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.789. The score was validated
in a group of 380 patients who were prospectively evaluated.

CONCLUSION

Prolonged hospitalization, body temperature, and elevated heart rate
were related to positive blood cultures. The Pitt score can be used to
assess the risk of death; however it can be individualized according
to the epidemiology of each hospital.

AB  - OBJECTIVE

Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia patients characteristics at a
tertiary hospital are described, and complications, mortality and
associated factors are analyzed.

METHODS

Data from patients with S. aureus bacteremia admitted between March
2020 and February2021 at Miguel Servet university hospital in Zaragoza
were retrospectively analyzed.

RESULTS

Results showed a 14 days mortality of 24.2% and an 30 days mortality
of 40%. Overall survival decreased with complications appearance [HR
3.1 (1.2-8.05)] and age over 65 years [HR 3.1 (1.4-6.6)]. The adjusted
analysis showed correlation between a higher mortality at 14 and 30
days with age over 65 years [OR 6.3 (1.7-23.1)], sepsis presence [OR
19.3 (5.4-68.7)] and number of positive (+) blood cultures ≥3 [OR 5.4
(0.8-34.1)]. Mortality at 14 days was associated with sepsis presence
[OR 58.2 (5.7-592.9)], number of positive (+) blood cultures ≥3 [OR
14.1 (1.1-173.7)] and an older age [OR 1.1 (1.03-1.1)]. Analyzing time
to positive blood cultures ≤12 hours and number of positive blood
cultures ≥ 3 at the same time, frequency of sepsis increased [30
patients (66.6%) vs 15 patients (33.3%); OR 3.4 (IC95% 1.5-8)].

CONCLUSIONS

High 14- and 30-days mortality were found, as well as a worse
evolution in older age patients, with sepsis presence, and with
greater number of positive blood cultures and times to positive blood
cultures ≤12 h.

AB  - Introduction: Although survival from septic shock is improved when
initial antimicrobial therapy is appropriate for pathogenic isolates,
critical timing elements with respect to initial antimicrobial therapy
of septic shock have not been defined in relation to onset of
hypotension. Hypothesis: Duration of time from first onset of
recurrent/persistent hypotension to administration of effective
antimicrobial therapy is a critical determinant of survival in human
septic shock. Methods: Data was extracted from the medical records of
2600 ICU patients with septic shock. Outcome was stratified based on
time to administration of effective antimicrobial therapy,
appropriateness of initial therapy, and other therapeutic variables.
Results: Overall mortality was 52.4%. Median time to implementation of
effective antimicrobial therapy following onset of hypotension was
6.25 hrs with 19.6% of patients receiving initially inappropriate
therapy. Duration of hypotension prior to effective antimicrobial
therapy initiation was strongly correlated with outcome (p<0.0001).
Odds ratio of death increased progressively with delays in initiation
of appropriate therapy with a 5-10% decrease in survival with every
hour delay over the first 6 hrs. By the 2nd hour after onset of
hypotension, survival was significantly reduced relative to initiaton
of therapy within the first hour (p<0.05). In a multivariate model
with initial appropriateness of antimicrobials, use of 2 or more
bacteriocidal antimicrobials and severity of illness (APACHE II), time
to effective therapy remained highly predictive of outcome (p<0.0001).
Conclusions: Rapid initiation of effective antimicrobial therapy
following first onset of recurrent or persistent hypotension is a
critical determinant of outcome in human septic shock. Given the
substantial deterioration in mortality as a consequence of even modest
delays, antimicrobial administration should represent an intrinsic
resuscitative priority.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS

A retrospective evaluation was undertaken in intestinal failure (IF)
patients with long term CVCs to evaluate differential time to
positivity (DTP) against paired quantitative blood cultures (PP) for
the diagnosis of CRBSI.

METHODS

A list of patients with a diagnosis of CRBSI was obtained from the
intestinal failure unit database for a five year period, 2013 to 2017.
Microbiology records were reviewed to obtain further information about
blood culture and pour plate examinations. Organisms and times of
collection, loading and positivity were recorded. Patients with a
contemporaneous set of central and peripheral PP and blood cultures
were included in an analysis of the sensitivity of DTP compared to PP.

RESULTS

There were 61 (45.5%) episodes in 56 patients where complete sets of
central and peripheral blood cultures and PP were received. All 61
episodes had positive central blood cultures, 59 (96.7%) had positive
central line PP and 17 (27.9%) had positive peripheral PP. Using PP as
the gold standard, DTP sensitivity was 96.0% for 50 episodes where PP
were consistent with CRBSI. Sensitivity increased to 100% for 17
episodes where there were no delays in either collection or loading of
blood cultures.

CONCLUSIONS

This is the first evaluation to support the use of DTP as a sensitive
test in diagnosing CRBSI in patients with IF and provides confidence
to IF centers where pour plate cultures are not available.

AB  - Abstract Background Early identification of patients at high risk of
morbidity and mortality following Gram-negative bloodstream infections
(GN-BSI) based on initial clinical course may prompt adjustments to
optimize diagnostic and treatment plans. This retrospective cohort
study aims to develop early clinical failure criteria (ECFC) to
predict unfavorable outcomes in patients with GN-BSI. Methods Adults
with community-onset GN-BSI who survived hospitalization for at least
96 hours at Palmetto Health hospitals in Columbia, SC, USA from
January 1, 2010 to June 30, 2015 were identified. Multivariate
logistic regression was used to examine association between clinical
variables within 72–96 hours of BSI and unfavorable outcomes (28-day
mortality or hospital length of stay >14 days). Results Among 766
patients with GN-BSI, 225 (29%) had unfavorable outcomes. After
adjustments for Charlson Comorbidity Index and appropriateness of
empirical antimicrobial therapy in multivariate model, predictors of
unfavorable outcomes included systolic blood pressure <100 mmHg or
vasopressor use (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.8, 95% confidence
interval [CI] 1.1–2.5), heart rate >100/minute (aOR 1.7, 95% CI
1.1–2.5), respiratory rate ≥22/minute or mechanical ventilation (aOR
2.1, 95% CI 1.4–3.3), altered mental status (aOR 4.5, 95% CI 2.8–7.1),
and peripheral WBC count >12 × 103/mm3 (aOR 2.7, 95% CI 1.8–4.1) at
72–96 hours from index BSI. Area under receiver operating
characteristic curve of ECFC model in predicting unfavorable outcomes
was 0.77 (0.84 and 0.71 in predicting 28-day mortality and prolonged
hospitalization separately, respectively). Predicted 28-day mortality
increased from 1% in patients with no ECFC to 3%, 7%, 16%, 32%, and
54% in presence of each additional criterion (P < 0.001). Predicted
hospital length of stay was 7.5 days in patients without any ECFC and
increased by 4.0 days (95% CI 3.1–4.9, P < 0.001) in presence of each
additional criterion. Conclusion Risk of 28-day mortality or prolonged

AB  - The implications of the variables within the pre-analytical phase of
blood culture processing are poorly understood. This study aims to
explore the effect of transit times (TT) and culture volume, on time
to microbiological diagnosis and patient outcomes. Blood cultures
received between 1st March and 31st July 2020/21 were identified. TT,
time in incubator (TII), and for positive samples, request to
positivity times (RPT) were calculated. Demographic details were
recorded for all samples, and culture volume, length of stay (LoS),
and 30-day mortality for patients with positive samples. Statistical
analysis examined how culture volume and TT effected culture
positivity and outcome; in the context of the 4-h national TT target.
Totally, 14,375 blood culture bottles were received from 7367
patients; 988 (13.4%) were positive for organisms. There was no
significant difference between TT of negative and positive samples.
The RPT was significantly lower for samples with TT < 4 h (p < 0.001).
Culture bottle volume did not affect RPT (p = 0.482) or TII
(p = 0.367). A prolonged TT was associated with a longer
length-of-stay in those with a bacteraemia with a significant organism
(p = 0.001). We found shorter blood culture transportation time was
associated with a significantly faster time of positive culture
reporting, while optimal blood culture volume did not make a
significant impact. Delays in reporting for significant organisms
correspond to a prolonged LoS. Laboratory centralisation makes
achieving the 4-h target a logistical challenge; however, this data
suggests such targets have significant microbiological and clinical
impacts.

AB  - Background Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is
associated with high mortality rates. Despite antibiotic therapy,
persistent bacteremia is challenging to treat. Combination therapy
with ceftaroline has emerged as a potential treatment option; however,
the optimal duration and clinical implications after bacteremia
clearance are unknown. Methods This retrospective cohort study
examined patients with high-grade or persistent MRSA bacteremia who
were treated with ceftaroline combination therapy at the University of
New Mexico Hospital between January 2014 and June 2021. Patients were
categorized into short- (<7 days) or long-duration (≥7 days) groups
based on the duration of combination therapy after bacteremia
clearance. Outcomes included 30-day all-cause mortality, bacteremia
recurrence, post-bacteremia clearance length of stay, and adverse
events. Results A total of 32 patients were included in this study.
The most common sources of bacteremia were bone/joint and endovascular
(28.1%, 9/32 each). The median duration of combination therapy after
clearance was seven days (IQR 2.8, 11). Patients in the long-duration
group had a lower Charlson comorbidity index (1.0 vs 5.5, p = 0.017)
than those in the short-duration group. After adjusting for
confounders, there was no significant difference in the 30-day
all-cause mortality between the groups (AOR 0.17, 95% CI 0.007–1.85, p
= 0.18). No association was found between combination therapy duration
and recurrence (OR 2.53, 95% CI 0.19–inf, p = 0.24) or adverse drug
events (OR 3.46, 95% CI 0.39–74.86, p = 0.31). After controlling for
total hospital length of stay, there was no significant difference in
the post-bacteremia clearance length of stay between the two groups (p
= 0.37). Conclusions Prolonging ceftaroline combination therapy after
bacteremia clearance did not significantly improve outcomes in
patients with persistent or high-grade MRSA bacteremia. The
limitations of this study warrant cautious interpretation of its
results. Larger studies are needed to determine the optimal duration
and role of combination therapy for this difficult-to-treat infection.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To identify factors associated with antibiotic treatment
delay in patients admitted with bloodstream infections (BSIs). DESIGN:
Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: North Zealand Hospital, Denmark.
PATIENTS: Adult patients with positive blood cultures obtained within
the first 48 hours of admission between January 1, 2015, and December
31, 2015 (n = 926). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: First recorded
Early Warning Score (EWS), patient characteristics, time to antibiotic
treatment, and survival at day 60 after admission were obtained from
electronic health records and medicine module. Presence of
contaminants and the match between the antibiotic treatment and
susceptibility of the cultured microorganism were included in the
analysis. Data were stratified according to EWS quartiles. Overall,
time from admission to prescription of antibiotic treatment was 3.7
(3.4–4.0) hours, whereas time from admission to antibiotic treatment
was 5.7 (5.4–6.1) hours. A gap between prescription and administration
of antibiotic treatment was present across all EWS quartiles.
Importantly, 23.4% of patients admitted with BSI presented with an
initial EWS 0–1. Within this group of patients, time to antibiotic
treatment was markedly higher among nonsurvivors at day 60 compared
with survivors. Furthermore, time to antibiotic treatment later than 6
hours was associated with increased mortality at day 60. Among
patients with an initial EWS of 0–1, 51.3% of survivors received
antibiotic treatment within 6 hours, whereas only 19.0% of
nonsurvivors received antibiotic treatment within 6 hours.
CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with initial low EWS, delay in antibiotic
treatment of BSIs was associated with increased mortality at day 60.
Lag from prescription to administration may contribute to delayed
antibiotic treatment. A more frequent reevaluation of patients with
infections with a low initial EWS and reduction of time from
prescription to administration may reduce the time to antibiotic
treatment, thus potentially improving survival.

AB  - The clinical aspects of persistent bacteremia (PB) caused by
gram-negative rods (GNRs) in terms of antimicrobial resistance (AMR)
and PB clearance status are unclear. This secondary analysis of a
retrospective cohort study investigated differences in PB caused by
Enterobacterales and glucose non-fermentative GNRs (NF-GNRs) based on
AMR and PB clearance. We retrospectively surveyed medical records at
Tohoku University Hospital. Patients for whom blood cultures were
performed between January 2012 and December 2021 were recruited. PB
cases were grouped based on AMR and PB clearance; the characteristics
of PB due to each bacterial pathogen were examined. The main outcome
variable was mortality. The late (30–90-day) mortality rate was
significantly higher in the multidrug-resistant (MDR) group than in
the non-MDR group for Enterobacterales. However, no significant
difference was noted in mortality rates between NF-GNRs with and
without AMR. Mortality rates tended to be higher in the
non-PB-clearance group than in the clearance group for both
Enterobacterales and NF-GNRs. Since the mortality rate was higher in
the MDR group in the case of Enterobacterales PB, more careful
management is necessary for this condition. Follow-up blood cultures
and confirming the clearance of PB are useful for improving the
survival rate.

AB  - Background Candidemia caused by Candida tropicalis has more serious
adverse consequences and an even higher mortality. Time to positivity
(TTP) has been widely used to identify microbial species, resistant
microorganisms and distinguish real pathogens and pollutants. However,
few studies have demonstrated TTP as a presumptive diagnosis of C.
tropicalis in patients with candidemia. Patients and Methods A
retrospective study of 136 episodes of candidemia and simulated blood
cultures with 314 episodes of confirmed Candida strains were applied
to explore the role of TTPs in diagnosing C. tropicalis. TTPs were
recorded as the shorter one if both aerobic and anaerobic vials were
positive. Lastly, relationships were tested between TTPs and
resistance and initial inocula concentration. Results For the
retrospective study, the mean of TTPs for C. tropicalis from 136
patients with candidemia was significantly shorter than other Candida
species. The area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC)
curve was 0.8896 ± 0.030 with a sensitivity of 92.86% and a
specificity of 77.87%, respectively, indicating TTPs with a cut-off
value of <25.50 h had a strong diagnostic power for C. tropicalis in
patients with candidemia. Moreover, TTPs from 314 simulated blood
cultures showed similar results as the retrospective study,
demonstrating TTP is a powerful diagnostic tool in early diagnosing C.
tropicalis in patients with candidemia. Additionally, our results
showed no statistical significance between TTPs and initial inocula
concentration and resistance of Candida species, suggesting initial
inocula concentration does not impact TTPs, and TTPs may not be
promising in predicting the resistance of all Candida species.
Conclusion TTP can be employed to early distinguish C. tropicalis from
other Candida species in patients with candidemia, which is extremely
helpful to initiate empiric antifungal treatments to improve clinical
outcomes.

AB  - Background: Rapid diagnosis and identification of pathogens are
pivotal for appropriate therapy of blood stream infections. The
T2Bacteria®Panel, a culture-independent assay for the detection of
Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus,
Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas
aeruginosa in blood, was evaluated under real-world conditions as a
point-of-care method including patients admitted to the internal
medicine ward due to suspected blood stream infection. Methods:
Patients were assigned to two groups (standard of care—SOC vs. T2). In
the SOC group 2 × 2 blood culture samples were collected, in the T2
group the T2Bacteria®Panel was performed additionally for pathogen
identification. Results: A total of 94 patients were included.
Pathogens were detected in 19 of 50 patients (38%) in the T2 group
compared to 16 of 44 patients (36.4%) in the SOC group. The median
time until pathogen detection was significantly shorter in the T2
group (4.5 h vs. 60 h, p < 0.001), as well as the time until targeted
therapy (antibiotic with the narrowest spectrum and maximal
effectiveness) (6.4 h vs. 42.2 h, p = 0.043). Conclusions: The
implementation of the T2Bacteria®Panel for patients with sepsis leads
to an earlier targeted antimicrobial therapy resulting in earlier
sufficient treatment and decreased excessive usage of broad-spectrum
antimicrobials.

AB  - OBJECTIVE

To explore the prognostic risk factors of bloodstream infection (BSI)
in intensive care unit (ICU) patients, furthermore, to provide a
reliable evidence for early warning and treatment for the critical
patients with BSI.

METHODS

A retrospective study was performed. The clinical data of patients
with blood culture-positive admitted to ICU of the Affiliated Hospital
of Guizhou Medical University from January 1 to September 30, 2019
were analyzed. The data including gender, age, proportion of basic
diseases, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE
II), the duration of mechanical ventilation after being diagnosed with
BSI, length of stay in ICU, aggressive operation and blood product
infusion after BSI, proportion of using continuous renal replacement
therapy (CRRT) and continuous vasoactive agents for more than 72 hours
after being diagnosed with BSI, and site of central venous
catheterization were recorded. Meantime, the worst laboratory values
within 72 hours after being diagnosed with BSI, information about
pathogenic microorganism categories and distributions were collected
and analyzed. The patients were divided into survival and death groups
based on the the 28-day prognosis, and the differences of clinical
data between the two groups were compared. Logistic regression
analysis was used to select the independent prognostic risk factors of
BSI.

RESULTS

One hundred and fifty-four patients with positive results of BSI were
enrolled, and the 156 strains of bacteria were detected, including 75
Gram positive (G+) bacteria strains, 70 Gram negative (G-) bacteria
strains and 11 fungi strains among those BSI patients. The top five
pathogenic microorganisms were Coagulase negative staphylococcus
(35.9%), Klebsiella pneumonia (12.8%), Acinetobacter baumannii (9.0%),
Enterococci (9.0%), and Escherichia coli (8.3%). There were 45 strains
(60.0%) of multidrug-resistant strains in G+ bacteria and 40 strains
of multidrug-resistant strains (57.1%) in G- bacterial strains, but in
fungi there was only 1 strain (9.1%). There were 81 cases in survival
group and 73 cases in death group according to 28-day prognosis. We
found that there were no significant differences between the
comparators in age, lenth of stay in ICU, duration for mechanical
ventilation after being diagnosed with BSI, percentage of BSI with
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension,
cardiovascular disease or chronic kidney dysfunction (all P > 0.05).
In death group, the proportion of male was obviously lower than that
of survival group [58.9% (43/73) vs. 75.3% (61/81), P < 0.05] and
APACHE II score was significantly higher than that in survival group
(27.1±7.0 vs. 19.5±6.7, P < 0.05). The mean arterial pressure (MAP) of
death group on first 3 days of BSI was significantly lower than that
of survival group [mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa): 72.8±13.6 vs. 79.7±12.9,
P < 0.05), in the death group, the proportion of patients complicated
with diabetes, cancer [28.8% (29/73) vs. 12.3% (10/81), 19.2% (14/73)
vs. 7.4% (6/81)], post-BSI CRRT and blood transfusion [39.7% (29/73)
vs. 16.0% (13/81), 64.4% (47/73) vs. 46.9% (38/81)], and continuous
use of asoactie drugs for ≥ 72 hours [37.0% (27/73) vs. 12.3% (10/81)]
were significantly higher than those in the survival group (all P <
0.05). In death group, platelet count (PLT) was significantly
decreased than that of survival group [×109/L: 124.93±98.21 vs.
181.15±116.39,P < 0.05], aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level was
significantly higher than that of survival group [U/L: 75.40 (38.50,
140.95) vs. 56.20 (29.20, 85.70), P < 0.05], the rest of the
laboratory indexes had no statistically significant differences
between the two groups (all P > 0.05). The results of Logistic
regression analysis showed that the APACHE II score [odds ratio (OR) =
1.279, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 1.158 to 1.412, P < 0.001],
CRRT after BSI (OR = 3.522, 95%CI was 1.013 to 12.245, P = 0.048) were
independent risk factors affecting the prognosis of patients with BSI,
and MAP is a protective factor for prognosis (OR = 0.961, 95%CI was
0.927 to 0.996, P = 0.031).

CONCLUSIONS

In our ICU, G+ bacteria are still dominant in bloodstream infection,
G- bacteria take the second place. Besides, APACHE II score and CRRT
after being diagnosed with BSI are the independent prognostic risk
factors.

TY  - JOUR
AB  - In the present issue of Infectious Diseases, an article by S. Morioka
determined that a time to positivity (TTP) of 16 h was associated with
CoNS bacteraemia, while that of >20 h was associated with CoNS
contamination in cancer patients [1]. They have only used an
objective, non-judgmental definition for CoNS contamination to avoid
confounding bias with clinical findings. In our opinion, some factors
must be taken into consideration when definition of ‘true bacteraemia’
and contamination is assessed. Despite authors stated that nurses drew
blood at different sites in every single set, it is difficult to
ensure it in a retrospective study. Sometimes, in oncologic patients
and in real life, blood is drawn through the catheter and this could
lead to false positive results, thus it cannot be completely excluded
in a retrospective study. Proper collection of blood cultures helps to
maximize the identification of true pathogens. Otherwise, misdiagnosis
of a contamination as true infection may lead to over-use of
antibiotics [2]. Skin preparation using antiseptics is an essential
step to avoid contamination [3–5]. It is important to highlight the
need to perform surveillance programs to assess the compliance with
blood cultures practices and to perform continuous education and
training to the personnel ensuring that blood cultures are obtained
following the recommendations [6,7]. Once the possibility of ‘false
positive’ results has been ruled out, another important factor that
plays an important role in the definition of ‘true bacteraemia’ is the
blood volume and number of sets collected. The authors did not
calculate the amount of blood in each blood culture bottle, which it
has been clearly related to TTP [8]. Two to four sets of blood
specimens should be collected and each set should consist of 20–40mL
of blood (except for children, which must not exceed 1% of the
patient’s total blood volume) [6]. In situations in which this has not
been properly assessed, false negative blood cultures results may
appear [2]. Besides, another important variable to take into
consideration is the rate of positive blood culture bottles from the
total number of the blood culture bottles withdrawn, which can also
help us to differentiate a true CoNS bacteraemia from contamination.
Some of these issues would explain why in the study of Morioka et al.
they could not reach almost 90% of specificity and sensitivity for
predicting CoNS bacteraemia and contamination, respectively. Many
attempts based on different variables, such as molecular or number of
positive blood culture sets, have been made to try to differentiate
true CoNS bacteraemia from contamination [9–13]. However, one of the
most rapid and easy-to-use method would be that directly based on the
TTP of the blood cultures which, as it has been stated by Morioka et
al. and other authors that also considered clinical criteria, when it
is approximately >20 h, it would be reliable enough for predicting
true CoNS bacteraemia [14–17]. In addition, Garcia-Vazquez et al. also
recommend to use a clinical algorithm to detect a clinically
significant CoNS bacteraemia [18]. In this regard, we consider that an
algorithm combining clinical and microbiological variables, such as
TTP, number of positive blood culture, and volume of blood could be
useful as indicative when diagnosing CoNS bacteraemia in a general
basis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of short-term incubation (STI)
protocol on clinical outcomes of bloodstream infection (BSI) patients.

METHODS

A total of 1363 positive blood culture records from January 2019 to
December 2021 were included. The main clinical outcomes included
pathogen identification turnaround time (TAT), antimicrobial
susceptibility testing (AST) TAT, and length of total hospital stay.

RESULTS

The TAT of pathogen identification and AST significantly decreased
after implementing the STI protocol (2.2 vs 1.4 days and 3.4 vs 2.5
days, respectively, with P < .001 for both). Moreover, for patients
with Gram-negative bacteria (GNB)-infected BSIs, the length of total
hospital stay decreased from 31.9 days to 27.1 days, indicating that
these patients could be discharged 5 days earlier after implementing
the STI protocol (P < .01).

CONCLUSION

The protocol led to a significant reduction in TAT and improved
clinical outcomes, particularly for GNB organisms. The findings
suggest that the STI protocol can improve patient outcomes and
hospital resource utilization in the management of BSIs.

AB  - To the Editor: In a recent issue of Critical Care Medicine, we read
with interest the report by Sterling et al (1), who performed a
meta-analysis on the effect of antimicrobial timing on mortality
outcomes in severe sepsis and septic shock. Sterling et al (1)
acknowledge the heterogeneity of data currently available in the
literature, but found in their analyses that time to antimicrobial
therapy did not correlate with mortality. They uphold early
appropriate antimicrobial therapy as a tenet of sepsis care, while
cogitating about the inflection point of mortality with respect to
antimicrobial timing. Their findings are contradictory to the most
recent guidelines for management of sepsis (2). We have recently
published a retrospective analysis of Enterobacteriaceae sepsis,
severe sepsis, and septic shock among patients who all received
appropriate antibiotic therapy within 12 hours of the time that a
positive blood culture was collected. In that cohort, we found no
correlation between 30-day mortality and timing of antibiotic therapy
(3). The strengths of our study include the homogeneous pathogen
population and the elimination of inappropriate therapy as a
confounding variable for mortality. We have taken data from our prior
study and analyzed mortality within each sepsis classification with
respect to timing of appropriate therapy. As seen in Figure 1, there
was no difference in time to appropriate antimicrobial therapy between
survivors and nonsurvivors among sepsis Antoine Duclos, MD, PhD,

AB  - BACKGROUND

To identify the epidemiology and risk factors with influence in the
outcome and mortality of a series of bacteriemic patients.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

A prospective study of bloodstream infections with clinical
significance detected in a secondary hospital of 650 beds over period
from May 1998 to May 1999. The true bacteriemia was defined in basis
to the criteria both the physician and microbiologist. A total of 16
variables were defined and categorized such as clinical-epidemiologic,
intrinsic risk factor, extrinsic risk factor, outcome and survival. We
used SPSS statistical package: For cuantitative variables we carried
out with the mean with confidence interval of 95%, for cualitative
variables: number and %. Univariate analysis of the results was
carried out with the X2 test and t Student, the survival was expressed
with Kaplan Meyer graphics and the logistic regression model.

RESULTS

A total of 320 positive blood cultures were studied but only 272 blood
cultures were considered true bacteriemia in 259 patients. The
calculated incidence of significant episodes of bacteriemia per 1000
admissions/year was 13. The overall mortality was 22% whereas death
attributable to bacteriemia was 16%. The mean age was 66.9 years (IC
95% 65-69), 59% episodes occurred in men. The 78% episodes occurred in
patients hospitalized in medical services. 52% episodes were of
nosocomial infection and 48% of community acquired infection.
According to the severity of the underlying disease, 15% had fatal
diseases and 35% episodes occurred in patients without underlying
disease. According to the univariant analysis, the variables which
where significantly associated with greater risk death were: etiology
(fungus), septic shock, the inadequate antibiotic therapy, presence of
extrinsic factors (central intravenous catheter, performance of
invasive procedures, previous antimicrobial therapy) and the hospital
stay of less than 10 days. According to the multivariable analysis
showed that the factors remaining independent predictors of mortality
were: septic shock (p < 0.0001, OR: 8), inadequate antimicrobial
therapy (p < 0.005, OR: 6.7), existence of two or more extrinsic risk
factors (p < 0.04).

CONCLUSIONS

The presence of septic shock was the most important variable which
influenced in the mortality in our serie, together with inappropriate
antimicrobian therapy and the association of various extrinsic risk
factors. These variables could be modified partly, for this reason the
aggressive hemodynamic control and the early and appropriate
antibiotic therapy would be the support of the successful bacteriemia
management.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of the present study was to determine whether
de-escalation guided by blood cultures for patients with a diagnosis
of sepsis, severe sepsis or septic shock reduces mortality, and
antimicrobial drug resistance (ADR). Methods: A prospective,
single-center, cohort study was conducted with adults admitted to the
ICU with a diagnosis of sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock at a
public hospital in Sorocaba, State of São Paulo, Brazil, from January
2013 to December 2013. We excluded patients who had negative blood
cultures. Patients who had replaced the initial empirical
broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy (EAT) by the antibiotic therapy
guided by blood cultures were compared with those who continued
receiving EAT. The outcome included mortality and antimicrobial drug
resistance. We used the Cox regression (proportional hazards
regression) and the Poisson regression to analyze the association
between antibiotic therapy guided by blood cultures (ATGBC) and
outcomes. The statistical adjustment in all models included the
following variables: sex, age, APACHE II (Acute Physiology And Chronic
Health Evaluation II) score and SOFA (Sequential Organ Failure
Assessment) score. Results: Among the 686 patients who were admitted
to the intensive care unit, 91 were included in this study. The mean
age of the patients was 52.7 years (standard deviation = 18.5 years)
and 70.3% were male. EAT was replaced by ATGBC in 33 patients (36.3%)
while 58 patients (63.7%) continued receiving EAT. Overall hospital
mortality decreased from 56.9% in patients who received EAT to 48.5%
in patients who received ATGBC [Hazard ratio- HR 0.44 (95% CI
0.24–0.82), p = 0.009]. There was no association between ATGBC and ADR
[HR 0.90 (95% CI 0.78 – 1.03) p = 0.15]. Conclusions: Although the
early and appropriate empirical EAT is undoubtedly an important factor
prognostic, ATGBC can reduce the mortality in these patients.

AB  - Background: Time to antibiotic administration (TTA) is well recognized
as determinant of mortality in patients with sepsis. Few studies that
have investigated the impact of the TTA on the mortality of patients
with febrile neutropenia (FN) are available. The aim of the study was
to determine relationship between TTA and negative clinical outcomes
(intensive care unit [ICU] admission, in-hospital mortality) in adult
cancer patients with FN treated with chemotherapy. Methods &
Materials: A prospective study was conducted to show for all
consecutive events of FN from June 2014 to June 2017. Demographic,
microbiologic and clinical data were recorded. TTA was defined as the
time between the onset of fever and antibiotic administration. Results
are presented as median for numerical variables and percentage for
categorical ones. To compare proportions chi2 test was used. A value
of p < 0.05 was considered significant. Results: One hundred nine
events of FN in 67 patients (32 men and 35 women) were evaluated.
Hematological malignancies account for most cases of cancer (72.5%).
One or more comorbidity factor was present in 52.3%. In 70.6% of cases
the absolute neutrophils count were < 100 cell/ mm3. Bloodstream
infections were responsible for 23,8%. Overall 22.7% cases with
hematologic malignancies required ICU admission compared with 6.6%
solid tumor (p = 0.06). The TTA in survival group was 133.37 minutes
versus 222.27 in mortality group. During the study there were 11
deaths (10.1% of all cases) of which 82% (p = 0.06) required ICU
admission. While univariate analysis age, bloodstream infections, ICU
admission and TTA were significantly correlated with mortality, the
hematological malignancies and bloodstream positive were related with
ICU admission. On multivariate analysis no variables significantly
correlated with mortality or ICU admission. Conclusion: This
preliminary study did not show association between delay in TTA and
hospital mortality or ICU admission. However, the early administration
of the empirical antibiotic therapy continues to be an important risk
factor in the prognosis of the FN patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Persistent Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) is
defined based on varying duration in literature. The primary objective
was to determine the risk of poor outcomes in relation to bacteremia
duration.METHODS: Multicenter, prospective, observational study of
adult hospitalized patients with SAB. Medical records were reviewed
for pertinent data. Patients were grouped by bacteremia duration:
short (1-2 days), intermediate (3-6 days), and prolonged (≥7 days) and
compared for risk factors and outcomes.RESULTS: Of 884 patients, 63%
had short, 28% intermediate, and 9% prolonged bacteremia. Overall mean
age was 57 years, and 70% were male. The prolonged group had the
highest proportion of methicillin-resistant SAB (P < .0001). Choice of
antibiotic therapy did not significantly affect bacteremia duration;
however, time to source-control procedure was delayed in the prolonged
and intermediate groups compared with the short group (3.5 vs 3 vs 1
day, P < .0001). Metastatic complications, length of stay, and 30-day
mortality were progressively worse as bacteremia duration increased (P
< .0001). Every continued day of bacteremia was associated with a
relative risk of death of 1.16 (95% confidence interval, 1.10-1.22; P
< .0001), with a significant increase in risk starting at 3 days as
determined by receiver operating characteristic analysis.CONCLUSIONS:
Optimal management of SAB should target bacterial clearance as soon as
possible to minimize incremental risk of mortality with each day of
positive blood culture. Delay in source control but not type of
antistaphylococcal therapy was significantly associated with prolonged
bacteremia and worse outcomes.© The Author(s) 2019. Published by

AB  - Abstract Purpose Blood is one of the most important connective tissues
of human body. Bloodstream infection can range from inapparent
bacteremia till fulminant septic shock with high mortality. Presence
of microbes in blood whether continuously, intermittently, or
transiently is a grave risk to every organ of body. Culture of blood
is a vital tool to diagnose such infections. Drug susceptibility
patterns help in rationalizing therapy. Objective The aim of the study
is to perform bacteriological analysis and assess drug sensitivity
patterns of blood culture isolates and compare in light of other
associated variables. Design Retrospective observational study was
conducted from January 2009 to December 2013 at a tertiary care
hospital at Shillong, India. Blood samples were collected with aseptic
guidelines and cultured for 7 days. Growths were identified by
standard biochemical tests and subjected to sensitivity testing
according to Modified Kirby Bauer disk diffusion method. Data for
source of blood collection and duration of incubation were noted and
compared. Results A total of 658 (11.2%) pathogens were isolated from
5,867 bacteremia-suspected patient blood specimens. Contamination was
observed at the rate of 1.21%. Gram-negative organisms were the
predominant pathogens recovered, Klebsiella pneumoniae being the most
common. No significant difference was observed between the number of
organisms isolated within or beyond 48 hours. Acinetobacter baumannii
and K. pneumoniae have significantly higher chances (p < 0.05) of
isolation from central line catheters compared with peripheral
venipuncture. Conclusion Successful treatment of sepsis depends on
early diagnosis and proper antimicrobial therapy. Local knowledge of
bacteriological profile and antimicrobial sensitivity patterns helps
rationalize empiric treatment strategies.

AB  - ABSTRACT Delayed time to antimicrobial susceptibility results can
impact patients’ outcomes. Our study evaluated the impact of
susceptibility turnaround time (TAT) and inadequate empiric
antibacterial therapy (IET) in patients with bloodstream infections
(BSI) caused by Enterobacterales (ENT) species on in-hospital
mortality and length of stay (LOS). This retrospective, multicenter
investigation which included 29,570 blood ENT-positive admissions
across 161 US healthcare facilities evaluated the association between
antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) TAT, carbapenem
susceptibility, and empiric therapy on post-BSI in-hospital mortality
and LOS following an ENT BSI event in adult patients. After adjusting
for outcomes covariates, post-BSI in-hospital mortality was
significantly higher for patients in the IET vs adequate empiric
therapy (AET) group [odds ratio (OR): 1.61 (95% CI: 1.32, 1.98); P <
0.0001], and when AST TAT was >63 h [OR:1.48 (95% CI: 1.16, 1.90); P =
0.0017]. Patients with carbapenem non-susceptible (carb-NS) ENT BSI
had significantly higher LOS (16.6 days, 95% CI: 15.6, 17.8) compared
to carbapenem susceptible (carb-S, 12.2 days, 95% CI: 11.8, 12.6), (P
< 0.0001). Extended AST TAT was significantly associated with longer
LOS for TAT of 57–65 h and >65 h (P = 0.005 and P< 0.0001,
respectively) compared to TAT ≤42 h (reference). Inadequate empiric
therapy (IET), carb-NS, and delayed AST TAT are significantly
associated with adverse hospital outcomes in ENT BSI. Workflows that
accelerate AST TAT for ENT BSIs and facilitate timely and adequate
therapy may reduce post-BSI in-hospital mortality rate and LOS.
IMPORTANCE For patients diagnosed with bloodstream infections (BSI)
caused by Enterobacterales (ENT), delayed time to antimicrobial
susceptibility (AST) results can significantly impact in-hospital
mortality and hospital length of stay. However, this relationship
between time elapsed from blood culture collection to AST results has
only been assessed, to date, in a limited number of publications. Our
study focuses on this important gap using retrospective data from
29,570 blood ENT-positive admissions across 161 healthcare facilities
in the US as we believe that a thorough understanding of the dynamic
between AST turnaround time, adequacy of empiric therapy, post-BSI
event mortality, and hospital length of stay will help guide effective
clinical management and optimize outcomes of patients with ENT
infections. For patients diagnosed with bloodstream infections (BSI)

AB  - ABSTRACT Bloodstream infections cause great mortality and morbidity.
Real-time microbiological information has been shown to have an impact
on prognosis when combined with an antimicrobial stewardship (AMS)
program. dRAST is a rapid commercial antimicrobial susceptibility
testing (AST) system based on real-time microscopy. The primary
outcome of this trial was to compare positive blood culture’s
time-to-result (TTR), defined as time from Gram stain to AST report,
between dRAST and our standard of care in a real-life clinical
setting. Secondary outcomes included microbiological concordance, time
to antimicrobial stewardship recommendation (TAMS), and time to change
antimicrobial prescription (TCAP) in agreement with AMS
recommendation. We performed a prospective, open-label, randomized
(1:1) diagnostic clinical trial comparing dRAST and our standard of
care commercial MicroScan broth microdilution (MBMD)
(MicroScan-Walkaway, Beckman-Coulter, USA) in 277 hospitalized
patients with bacteremia. Categorical and continuous variables were
compared by chi-squared and Mann-Whitney U tests, respectively. Median
TTR, TAMS, and TCAP were 25, 28, and 29 hours in the MBMD group, and
9, 11, and 13 hours in the dRAST group, respectively. For
gram-negative bacilli, essential agreement (EA) was 93.6%, categorical
agreement (CA) 93.2%, very major error (VME) 14%, major error (ME) 3%,
and minor error (mE) 1.4%. For gram-positive cocci, EA was 93.7%, CA
92.8%, VME 0%, ME 7.6%, and mE 1.8%. dRAST is a reliable method for
guiding an antimicrobial stewardship program for bacteremia, allowing
significant reductions in TTR, TAMS, and TCAP that might impact
patient management and clinical outcomes. IMPORTANCE This study
addresses a critical challenge in infectious diseases management by
evaluating the efficacy of the dRAST system, a rapid antimicrobial
susceptibility testing method, in guiding antimicrobial stewardship
programs for patients with bloodstream infections. A randomized
diagnostic trial was designed to address this objective. Our findings
show that the use of dRAST significantly reduces time-to-result, time
to antimicrobial stewardship recommendations, and time to appropriate
therapy changes, particularly in critically ill patients. These
results underline the potential of rapid diagnostic technologies to
optimize patient outcomes and enhance antimicrobial stewardship
efforts in real-world clinical settings. This study addresses a

AB  - Abstract Background The incidence of complications in Gram negative
bloodstream infection (GN-BSI) is not clearly defined. This
retrospective cohort study evaluates the incidence of complications
within 90 days of GN-BSI and examines the predictors for these
complications. Methods Hospitalized adult patients with monomicrobial
GN-BSI at Prisma Health-Midlands hospitals in South Carolina between
1/1/2012 and 6/30/2015 were evaluated. Complications of GN-BSI were
defined as endocarditis, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, spinal
infections, deep seated abscesses, and recurrent GN-BSI within 90 days
of the initial episode. Clinical and microbiological variables were
assessed as potential risk factors for complications, including
initial response to antimicrobial therapy within the first 72-96 hours
of GN-BSI using the early clinical failure criteria. Kaplan-Meier
analysis and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression were
used to examine the incidence and risk factors of complicated GN-BSI,
respectively. Results A total 752 patients with GN-BSI were included
in the study. The median age was 66 years and 380 (50.6%) were women.
The urinary tract was the most common source of GN-BSI (378; 50.2%)
and Escherichia coli was the most common bacteria (375; 49.9%).
Overall, 13.9% developed complications within 90 days of GN-BSI. The
median time to identification of these complications was 5.2 days from
the index GN-BSI (interquartile range 1-28 days). The incidence of
complications was notably higher in BSI due to Serratia species
(39.7%), Proteus mirabilis (35.7%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (21.5%)
than other bacteria (11.1%; log-rank p< 0.001). Independent risk
factors for complications included early clinical failure criteria,
non-urinary source, presence of indwelling prosthetic devices, BSI due
to Serratia species, P. mirabilis or P. aeruginosa, and persistent
GN-BSI (Table). Conclusion At least 13.9% of patients developed
complications within 90 days of GN-BSI. Risk of development of
complications may be predicted by specific host and microbiological
factors. Stratification of patients based on these risk factors may
aid in identifying patients requiring further diagnostic work up for
early detection of complications. Disclosures Julie Ann Justo, PharmD,

AB  - BACKGROUND

We evaluated the contribution of a rapid antibiotic susceptibility
test performed directly from a positive blood culture (PBC), the
dRAST™, in the management of patients with bacteremia.

METHODS

We retrospectively compared the time from sampling to availability of
antibiotic susceptibility test (AST) results («time-to-result», TTR)
between dRAST™ and classic AST (Vitek®2), in 150 patients with
bacteremia. The antibiotic treatment of these 150 patients was
classified into three categories (optimal, suboptimal, ineffective)
according to the time of availability of AST results.

RESULTS

Adaptation of antibiotic treatment to optimal therapy following AST
results occurred in 46/100 (46 %) of Gram-negative PBC and in 4/50 (2

compared with classic AST (29:35 (± 08:48) hours versus 50:55 (±
12:45) hours, p < 0.001).

CONCLUSION

For patients with bacteremia requiring adjustment of empirical
antibiotic therapy based on AST, dRAST™ could allow a faster
administration of optimal therapy.

AB  - Since bacteraemia and sepsis often result in death, rapid detection
and identification of the pathogens, as well as prompt discrimination
of true infection from contamination could lead to reduction of
morbidity and mortality. After confirmative diagnosis of bloodstream
infection, judging potential infection source, predicting clinical
outcome and mortality risk, monitoring the adequacy of antibiotic
therapy are all beneficial to a better outcome of patients with
bloodstream infections. Time to positivity (TTP) can be defined as the
amount of time required for the organism to grow in the blood culture
and data have showed that the TTP could be used as a valuable aid in
the diagnosis of bloodstream infections and may influence the choice
of empirical antibiotic therapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND

Traditionally, skin and skin structure infections (SSSIs) have been
viewed as having a lower risk of mortality, morbidity, and cost
compared with other types of infection. The influence of secondary
bacteremia on the medicoeconomic outcomes of patients with SSSIs has
not been well described.

OBJECTIVE

The goal of this study was to evaluate the impact of bacteremia
complicating SSSIs on length of hospital stay and costs.

METHODS

This was a retrospective cohort study involving 579 patients with
culture-positive SSSIs who were admitted to Barnes-Jewish Hospital, a
major academic medical center, between April 1, 2005, and December 31,
2007. The outcomes evaluated in this analysis included hospital
mortality, length of stay, hospital costs, and hospital readmission.

RESULTS

Secondary bacteremia was present in 277 (47.8%) patients. Hospital
mortality was statistically greater among patients with bacteremia
(7.9% vs 1.0%; P < 0.001). The unadjusted median length of stay in
bacteremic patients was 7.1 days compared with 2.8 days in those
without bacteremia (P < 0.001 by log-rank test). This finding
correlated with total hospital costs, which were greater in patients
with bacteremia (median values: $14,623 vs $5841.50; P < 0.001). In a
Cox model controlling for multiple confounders, bacteremia
independently correlated with hospital duration (adjusted hazard ratio
[HR], 1.820; 95% CI, 1.654-2.003; P < 0.001) and hospital costs
(adjusted HR, 1.895; 95% CI, 1.723-2.083; P < 0.001). Hospital
readmission within 30 days of discharge was also significantly more
common among patients with SSSIs complicated by bacteremia (24.5% vs
12.9%; P < 0.001).

CONCLUSIONS

Bacteremia complicating SSSIs occurred in almost 50% of patients
infected with gram-positive bacteria in our institution. Beyond its
impact on mortality, bacteremia is associated with increased length of
stay, hospital costs, and readmission. However, these data are from a
single academic medical center and may not be adjusted for all
applicable confounders.

AB  - Abstract Objectives To evaluate the utility of follow-up blood
cultures (FUBCs) for Gram-negative bloodstream infection (BSI) in ICU
patients and identify risk factors for repeat positive cultures.
Methods This was a single-centre, retrospective cohort study of
critically ill adults with Gram-negative BSI between 1 January 2015
and 1 January 2020. Critically ill patients with one or more blood
cultures positive for a Gram-negative organism were included.
Descriptive and inferential statistics were performed with an alpha of
0.05. Results A total of 148 critically ill patients with
Gram-negative BSI were included, with 42 patients (28.4%) having one
or more positive FUBCs. The majority (66.2%) were admitted to a
medical ICU. The most common organisms isolated were Escherichia coli
(n = 56, 37.8%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 26, 17.6%). Significant
patient risk factors associated with a positive FUBC on univariate
regression included: MDR organisms, immunocompromised status, fever,
vasopressor use at time of FUBC, lack of source control attainment,
and higher quick Pitt bacteraemia score. Multivariable penalized
logistic regression indicated that lack of source control containment
and less time from index to FUBC remained significantly associated
with repeat positive FUBC. Conclusions This is the first study to
investigate the use of FUBC for Gram-negative BSI in exclusively ICU
patients. Risk factors for repeat positive FUBC in this population
include lack of source control and less time between index and FUBC.
Prospective studies are needed to fully elucidate the role of FUBCs in
critically ill patients with Gram-negative BSI.

AB  - Because the detection of bacteremia is an important indication for
subsequent treatment and prognosis, blood culture-positive results
should be reported as soon as possible. Here, we present our attempts
to promptly report the results of blood culture-positive samples and
successive support systems for medical examinations. The BacT/ALERT
system is used for culturing blood in our hospital. If a positive
blood culture is obtained, medical technologists at the
microbiological laboratory of our university hospital immediately
contact the corresponding ward regarding the results of Gram staining
and simultaneously inform the infectious disease physicians at the
Department of Infection Control and Prevention. By using the positive
blood cultures obtained from January 2003 to December 2004 (the period
during which only day shifts on weekdays was supported), we determined
the time required from blood specimen collection to obtaining positive
samples from the culture system. When the samples were inserted into
the system on the day following blood collection or later, the average
time required was 48 hours. On the other hand, when the samples were
inserted into the system on the day of blood collection, the average
time required was 33 hours. After consideration of the importance of
blood cultures, the examination system at the microbiological
laboratory was changed to support day shifts every day in May 2008.
The time taken from blood specimen collection for blood cultures to
obtaining positive samples from the system was 40 hours on an average
when day shifts were supported only on weekdays (during the above
mentioned period), whereas the average time required was 31 hours when
day shifts were supported every day (from May to June 2008). Since
January 2002, the Department of Infection Control and Prevention have
supported medical examinations for infectious diseases, including
blood culture-positive cases. Compared between before and after the
establishment of the support system (in 2001 and 2007), the 30-day
mortality rates from bloodstream infections with Staphylococcus aureus
and Candida spp. have improved from 30% to 17% and 56% to 23%,
respectively. As indicated in our results, it is important to
immediately deliver blood culture samples to the laboratory, start
blood cultures (insert into the system), promptly report the results
of Gram staining after the positive samples are obtained, and
administer suitable antibiotic treatment.

AB  - Critical Care Medicine www.ccmjournal.org 439 A 79 year-old woman is
admitted to the ICU with fever, flank pain, and intractable vomiting.
Urinalysis and images of her abdomen and pelvis are consistent with
pyelonephritis. Treated empirically with ceftriaxone, both blood and
urine cultures ultimately grow quinolone-sensitive Escherichia coli.
On hospital day 4, her IV access needs to be replaced per
institutional policy. Nursing is unable to obtain a secondary IV
access, and a peripherally inserted central catheter line is placed.
The patient completes a 14-day course of IV antibiotics for
pyelonephritis. Unfortunately, her hospital stay was complicated by
Clostridium difficile infection and an upper extremity deep vein
thrombosis requiring anticoagulation. Although this fictitious
clinical vignette is not typical of the majority of cases of
bacteremia, every experienced ICU practitioner has encountered such an
unfortunate patient and wondered whether a shorter course of
antibiotics would have resulted in a better outcome with fewer
complications. In this issue of Critical Care Medicine, Daneman et al
(1) have explored the issue of treating bacteremia in the ICU with the
hopes of answering this question. They conducted a large, multicenter
retrospective study of 1,202 Canadian ICU patients with bacteremia
excluding anyone with an infection who required a prolonged antibiotic
course as per established infectious disease (ID) guidelines
(endocarditis, osteomyelitis, etc.). Baseline characteristics were
notable for a relatively low prevalence of highly resistant infections
(approximately 9.5%) and the fact that there were few patients with
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (< 4%). The duration of
therapy was highly variable with a median of 14 days (interquartile
range, 9–17.5). When patients were dichotomized into groups receiving
shorter (≤ 10 d) or longer (> 10 d) antibiotic courses, a few
associations of questionable clinical importance using a multivariable
model were identified although a multitude of patient and pathogen
characteristics were considered. Patients were more likely to receive
a short duration of therapy if they had COPD, if they were burn
patients, if they were infected with coagulase negative staphylococci,
or if the source of infection was undetermined. Survival differences
between shorter and longer duration of therapy were not found despite
the authors using multiple statistical strategies. In essence, when
confounding by indication (addressed with propensity matching) and
survival bias (addressed both by repeating the propensity matched
analysis after successively excluding early deaths, as well as by
using a Cox proportional hazards model) were appropriately accounted
for, no mortality difference between the two treatment groups was
identified. On the basis of these data, it would be unwise to simply
conclude that courses of shorter and longer duration antibiotic
therapy were associated with similar outcomes and that either strategy
could be applied interchangeably in all cases of ICU bacteremia.
Despite propensity matching with 21 variables, it is very likely that
selection bias was not entirely eliminated. Thus, clinicians used
additional information (unmeasured in this study) when considering the
risks of a shorter antibiotic course (treatment failure) versus the
risk of a longer antibiotic course (Clostridium difficile infection,
development of microbial resistance, potential need for central line
access, venous thrombosis, line infection and bacteremia, and
increased cost). Besides highlighting the need for prospective trials,
this study reminds critical care practitioners to seek expert opinion
for managing bacteremia when guidelines and protocols are uncertain or
not available. Both ID and antibiotic stewardship (AS) engagement are
paramount. Nowhere is this more evident than in the treatment of
Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) in which management aided by ID
consultation is associated with better adherence to established
standards of care and—more importantly—a mortality benefit (2–4).

AB  - Abstract Background Serial blood cultures are integral in managing
Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) as clinicians rely on the
results to determine infectious complication risks and antibiotic
duration. Current IDSA guidelines suggest a single set of negative
blood cultures is adequate evidence of SAB clearance. Several studies,
however, have identified the skip phenomenon (SP), which is the
occurrence of intermittent negative blood cultures, and have
recommended obtaining additional blood cultures to document bacterial
clearance (Table 1). We therefore examined patients who manifested the
SP to determine its clinical significance and to study this,
associations were tested for SP in relation to various baseline
factors as well as clinical outcomes. Methods We performed a
retrospective, multicenter study of all patients with a positive blood
culture for S. aureus from January 2019 to December 2019 using data
collected from electronic health records and the clinical microbiology
laboratory. Results A total of 602 patients with SAB were identified
and 495 patients were included in the investigation (Figure 1).
Overall, 25 (5.1%) patients had the SP. Significant differences
between those who did and did not manifest the SP included higher
rates of injection drug use, automatic implantable cardioverter
defibrillator, and community onset of infection in the SP cohort
(Table 2). Moreover, the median duration of SAB was longer (3.2
[2.3-5.4] vs 1.90 [1.2-2.9] days, p=0.002), and high-grade SAB, (88.0%
vs 58.7%, p=0.004), complicated bacteremia (92.0% vs 67.9%, p=0.011)
and IE diagnosis (28.0% vs 11.3%, p=0.013) were all more common in the
SP group. In unadjusted outcome analyses, association of SP with
hospital length of stay was not significant, although a higher risk of
in-hospital mortality among SP patients approached statistical
significance (p=0.055). Analysis of 435 hospital survivors revealed no
significant differences in rates of 1-year mortality or 90-day relapse
between the two groups (Table 3). Conclusion Findings of the current
investigation demonstrates an increased risk of SAB complications in
patients with the SP and support the notion that serial negative blood
cultures are needed to document clearance of SAB. Disclosures Larry M.

AB  - BACKGROUND

The objective of this study was to examine the occurrence,
determinants, and outcome of S. aureus bloodstream infections (BSI)
diagnosed based on single versus multiple positive initial cultures.

METHODS

All adults with first episodes of mono-microbial S. aureus BSI in
Queensland during 2000-2019 were included.

RESULTS

10,855 (67%) and 5,421 (33%) were diagnosed based on one and multiple
positive initial cultures, respectively. Patients with multiple
positive initial cultures were significantly younger, more likely to
have community-associated disease, have a shorter time to culture
positivity, less likely to have methicillin-resistant S. aureus BSI,
and have a different distribution of comorbid medical illnesses and
clinical foci. The 30-day all-cause case-fatality rate was 18% and
single positive initial culture was an independent risk factor for
death.

CONCLUSIONS

Among patients with S. aureus BSI, those diagnosed by single positive
initial blood cultures have different clinical features and a higher
risk for death.

AB  - Abstract Background Bloodstream infections are associated with
significant morbidity, mortality, and costs. Timely initiation of
effective treatment is required for optimal outcomes. Conventional
microbiological techniques require 72 hours for organism
identification; however, rapid blood culture identification (BCID)
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) panels have expedited this process. At
Atlantic Health System, the BioFire® FilmArray® BCID panel was
implemented June 2020 (BCID1), with subsequent upgrade to BCID2 March
2021. Notable features of the BCID2 panel include speciation of
Enterococcus spp. and the addition of the CTX-M target. The purpose of
this study is to assess time to optimal therapy (TTOT) with and
without the BCID platforms for select organisms. Table 1: Select
Primary and Secondary Endpoints Methods This retrospective study of
hospitalized, adult patients was conducted at two community teaching
hospitals from 5/2019 to 12/2021. Patients with a blood culture
positive for Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, Proteus spp.,
Escherichia coli, or non-aerogenes Klebsiella spp. were included.
Patients with polymicrobial or presumed polymicrobial source of
bacteremia, recent positive blood cultures, PCR not performed in BCID
arms, or who were deceased/comfort care at time of Gram stain were
excluded. The primary endpoint was TTOT. Secondary endpoints included
time to effective therapy, duration of vancomycin, therapy
modification 24 hours after Gram stain result, and length of stay. All
analyses compared PreBCID to either BCID1 or BCID2 arm. Results Three
hundred patients (100 per arm) were included. Patient characteristics
were similar across study arms. The median Pitt Bacteremia Score was
1, the most common organism identified was E. coli (65%), the most
common source of bacteremia was genitourinary (65%), and 11% of
isolates produced ESBL. TTOT (days) was similar in PreBCID compared to
BCID1 and BCID2 [(2.48 vs. 2.65, p=0.10); (2.48 vs. 2.37 days,
p=0.27)]. TTOT was significantly longer in the gram-negative subgroup
of the BCID1 arm compared to PreBCID (2.62 vs 1.85 days, p=0.03). See
Table 1 for full analyses. Conclusion Implementation of the BCID
panels did not reduce TTOT in select organisms at our institution.
Barriers to benefit may include limited education and lack of formal
antimicrobial stewardship team involvement. Disclosures All Authors:

AB  - Abstract Background Early clinical failure criteria (ECFC) were
recently proposed to predict poor clinical outcomes in patients with
Gram-negative bloodstream infections (BSI). ECFC are measured between
72 and 96 hours from collection of index blood culture (Table 1). The
objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of ECFC in
predicting 28-day mortality in patients with Enterococcus spp. BSI.
Methods This IRB-approved, retrospective, observational cohort study
included adult patients hospitalized at Prisma Health–Midlands
hospitals from January 1, 2015 to July 31, 2018 with a monomicrobial
BSI due to Enterococcus spp. Patients with a previous episode of
Enterococcus spp. BSI within one year prior to index culture or those
who died within 72 hours were excluded. Multivariate logistic
regression was used to examine the association between ECFC and 28-day
all-cause mortality. The area under the receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curve was used to measure model discrimination.
Results A total of 157 patients with Enterococcus spp. BSI were
included. Overall, the median age was 66 years, 96 (61%) were men, and
106 (68%) had community-onset BSI. The urinary tract was the most
common source of infection (45; 29%), followed by intraabdominal
infections (34; 22%). Twenty-eight patients (18%) died within 28 days
of BSI. After adjustments for age and Charlson Comorbidity Index,
every one-point increase in the ECFC was associated with an 80%
increase in the odds of 28-day mortality (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.3–2.4, P <
0.001). Mortality increased from 4% in patients with ECFC of 0 to 11%,
28%, and 38% as ECFC increased to 1, 2, and ≥3, respectively. The area
under ROC curve of ECFC model in predicting 28-day mortality was 0.74
with ECFC of 2 identified as the best cutoff point. Mortality was 8%
in patients with ECFC < 2 compared with 33% in those with ECFC ≥2 (P <
0.001). Conclusion ECFC demonstrated good discrimination to predict
28-day mortality in hospitalized adult patients with Enterococcus spp.
BSI. These criteria may have utility as a stratification or
randomization tool in future clinical investigations evaluating
optimal antimicrobial treatment duration or effectiveness of
intravenous to oral switch therapy in uncomplicated Enterococcus spp.

AB  - Abstract Background It remains unclear if follow-up blood cultures
(FUBCs) for Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) bacteremia should be performed
routinely to document clearance of bacteremia due to lack of evidence
on the value of FUBCs for GNB bacteremia. Methods We conducted a
retrospective, multicenter observational study at 4 acute care
hospitals to examine if FUBCs are associated with length of hospital
stay, duration of antibiotic treatment, and mortality of hospitalized
patients with GNB bacteremia. Participants included adult patients who
were hospitalized between January 2017 and December 2018 with GNB
bacteremia. Patients with and without FUBCs were propensity
score-matched with a 1:1. The primary outcomes were in-hospital
mortality, length of hospital stay, and duration of antibiotic
treatment during the hospital stay. Results Of the 442 hospitalized
adult patients with GNB bacteremia, 381 were included in the study. Of
those, FUBCs were performed in 276 patients (72%). After propensity
score matching, we included 87 patients with FUBCs and 87 patients
without FUBCs for comparing outcomes. The median length of stay was
longer in patients with FUBCs (9 days [interquartile range, 6.0–14.0])
compared with patients without FUBCs (7 days [interquartile range,
4.5–10.5]; P=0.017). The median duration of antibiotic treatment was
also longer in patients with FUBCs (8 days [interquartile range
5.5–13.0]) compared with patients without FUBCs (6 days [interquartile
range, 4.0–10.0]; P=0.007). No statistically significant difference
was observed in in-hospital mortality between patients with and
without FUBCs (adjusted odds ratio = 0.37; 95% confidence interval,
0.081–1.36). Conclusion Performing FUBCs for GNB bacteremia were
associated with prolonged length of hospital stay and duration of
antibiotic treatment but not with mortality. Disclosures All Authors:

AB  - Prompt identification of Infective Endocarditis (IE) in patients with
Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) is important as delayed
diagnosis results in 15-20% increased mortality. Predictive clinical
scoring strategies have been developed to optimize the diagnostic
process, particularly the use of invasive methods such as
Transesophageal Echocardiography(TEE), known to be superior to
Transthoracic Echocardiography but is not suitable for all patients.
Three scoring systems have been proposed to predict the risk of IE:
VIRSTA, PREDICT and POSITIVE. We compared these scoring strategies in
combination with other clinical data to test the hypothesis that
inclusion of time to blood culture positivity(TTP) in the scoring
strategies might improve the sensitivity and specificity of clinical
risk stratification.

Adults (≥ 18y) with SAB admitted to Ochsner LSU Health Shreveport in
2020-2021 were retrospectively screened. Patients with polymicrobial
bacteremia, with index blood cultures obtained at a different
institution and without cardiac imaging were excluded. In this
preliminary analysis, 60 patients (30 with and without IE) were
studied. IE was defined as patients who met modified Dukes criteria
for definite IE. The three scores were calculated for each subject.
TTP, defined as the time from incubation to automated detection, was
obtained from the microbiology laboratory. Clinical predictors of IE
were identified using multivariable logistic regression analysis.

The demographic, baseline characteristics and mode of presentation,
was no different in both groups based on analysis of >50 factors. The
mean TTP for subjects with and without IE were no different (9.65h vs
11h, p=0.12) TTP≤13h as an independent variable was found to be
sensitive but not specific. VIRSTA was found to be the most sensitive
scoring method. POSITIVE, which includes TTP as a component, was the
most accurate, but least sensitive method. Addition of TTP≤13h to
VIRSTA and PREDICT increased sensitivity but lowered specificity.

While the sensitivity of scoring strategies is acceptable, none of the
proposed methods has adequate specificity. Larger studies are needed
for the development of a highly specific and accurate scoring method
that includes classic risk factors and TTP.

AB  - INTRODUCTION

Timely and appropriate therapy is critical in patients with
Gram-negative bloodstream infections (GNBSI). Most bacteriology
laboratories process blood specimen in the daytime, during laboratory
operating hours, and use conventional culture for antimicrobial
susceptibility testing (AST). We simulated the potential impact of
real-time processing and rapid AST (7 hours) on early adaptation of
the antibiotic regimen in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with
GNBSI.

METHODS

All GNBSI episodes occurring in the ICUs of 2 hospitals in Paris were
included. Data were collected. For each episode of bacteremia, we
simulated the impact of three strategies: (1) Real-time processing
coupled with conventional techniques (Gram stain and standard AST);
(2) Standard processing coupled with rapid AST; and (3) Real-time
processing coupled with rapid AST.

RESULTS

We included 109 episodes in 98 patients. Forty-two patients (48%) died
during ICU stay. AST results led to a change of the antibiotic regimen
in 66 (61%) episodes, mainly de-escalation (54/109, 55%). In standard
care, median time from sample collection to definitive AST result was
65.9 hours (±26.7). The three strategies would have reduced
time-to-result by 9.2 hours (±7.1), 30.8 hours (±19.7) and 40.0 hours
(±20.6) respectively. Compared to standard care, strategies 1, 2 and 3
would have avoided 20, 69 and 90 patient-days of broad-spectrum
antibiotics respectively.

CONCLUSION

In addition to real-time processing of blood samples, rapid AST would
be the most effective strategy to shorten time-to-result in critical
patients with GNBSI.

AB  - Shorter antibiotic durations (≤7 days) have demonstrated
non-inferiority to longer courses for several bacterial infections,
but evidence for bacteremia remains limited. Trials often exclude
patients with bacteremia, focus on uncomplicated cases, or lack
sufficient power to detect clinically significant effects. The recent
Bacteremia Antibiotic Length Actually Needed for Clinical
Effectiveness (BALANCE) trial, a multicenter study spanning 74
hospitals, investigated 7 versus 14 days of antibiotic therapy for
bloodstream infections, showing non-inferiority in 90-day all-cause
mortality. Despite these findings, a possible reluctance to adopt
shorter durations persists, as seen in high exclusion rates and
protocol deviations. BALANCE highlights the importance of source
control in managing bloodstream infections resulting in the relatively
low 7-day mortality. However, reliance on 90-day mortality may
underestimate clinical failure, with outcomes like suppurative or
distant complications and recurrence being more relevant. The trial
predominantly included non-severely immunocompromised patients with
community-acquired Gram-negative bacteremia, limiting generalizability
to multidrug-resistant or hospital-acquired infections. The BALANCE
trial, along with the previous three randomized control trials
comparing short- versus longer-duration antibiotics for Gram-negative
bacteremia, supports guideline recommendations for shorter antibiotic
courses in cases involving non-multidrug-resistant organisms,
non-severely immunocompromised patients, and effective source control.
It also highlights the importance of future trials prioritizing
clinically meaningful outcomes and underrepresented populations.

AB  - Introduction Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) is a
life-threatening infection particularly involving
methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). In contrast to resolving MRSA
bacteremia (RB), persistent MRSA bacteremia (PB) blood cultures remain
positive despite appropriate antibiotic treatment. Host immune
responses distinguishing PB vs. RB outcomes are poorly understood.
Here, integrated transcriptomic, IL-10 cytokine levels, and genomic
analyses sought to identify signatures differentiating PB vs. RB
outcomes. Methods Whole-blood transcriptomes of propensity-matched PB
(n=28) versus RB (n=30) patients treated with vancomycin were compared
in one independent training patient cohort. Gene expression (GE)
modules were analyzed and prioritized relative to host IL-10 cytokine
levels and DNA methyltransferase-3A (DNMT3A) genotype. Results
Differential expression of T and B lymphocyte gene expression early in
MRSA bacteremia discriminated RB from PB outcomes. Significant
increases in effector T and B cell signaling pathways correlated with
RB, lower IL-10 cytokine levels and DNMT3A heterozygous A/C genotype.
Importantly, a second PB and RB patient cohort analyzed in a masked
manner demonstrated high predictive accuracy of differential
signatures. Discussion Collectively, the present findings indicate
that human PB involves dysregulated immunity characterized by impaired
T and B cell responses associated with excessive IL-10 expression in
context of the DNMT3A A/A genotype. These findings reveal distinct
immunologic programs in PB vs. RB outcomes, enable future studies to
define mechanisms by which host and/or pathogen drive differential
signatures and may accelerate prediction of PB outcomes. Such
prognostic assessment of host risk could significantly enhance early
anti-infective interventions to avert PB and improve patient outcomes.

AB  - More than half of all deaths within one month of identification of
Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infection (SABI) occur within seven
days of the first positive culture. However, there has not been a
specific evaluation of studies of early mortality in patients with
SABI. The objectives were to analyze studies that reported the
seven-day all-cause mortality rate in patients with SABI and risk
factors for this outcome. We also hypothesized that studies of
gram-negative bloodstream infection (GNBI) or all episodes of BI
(gram-negative and gram-positive, including fungemia) that reported
seven-day all-cause mortality might provide other methods for
predicting this outcome. Early mortality was defined as death within
seven days following the first day blood cultures were positive. Of
751 studies of SABI reviewed, 23 reported seven-day all-cause
mortality rates. Studies were categorized into three groups: those
reporting data on all SABI, methicillin-susceptible SABI, or
methicillin-resistant SABI alone. Four studies of SABI evaluated risk
factors for early mortality. Of 545 studies of GNBI or all episodes of
BI, six evaluated factors predictive of seven-day all-cause mortality.
There was a significant difference in the mean seven-day all-cause
mortality rate between the three groups with SABI. However, there was
no significant difference between the three groups when the metric was
the proportion of all deaths within the first 30 days following the
first positive blood culture that occurred within the first seven days
(early death proportion). Overall, the median early death proportion
for 23 studies was 53% (interquartile range 49–57). Four studies
reported risk factors for early mortality, but all had methodological
limitations. Analysis of six studies of GNBI or all BI revealed that
an acute severity of illness model (bloodstream infection mortality
risk score) by itself accurately predicted seven-day all-cause
mortality. Concordance in the early death proportion in 23 studies
suggests a distinct group of patients with SABI is at risk for early
mortality. However, methodologically sound studies are needed to
identify all factors (clinical, diagnostic, and pathogen) associated
with early mortality to evaluate methods to potentially reduce
mortality in this group. Acute severity of illness models should be
evaluated for predicting early mortality in patients with SABI.
Bloodstream infections in which bacteria like Staphylococcus aureus
enter the bloodstream are deadly serious for patients. In fact,
studies of S. aureus bloodstream infection (SABI) mortality show that
among all deaths within 30 days of the first positive blood culture
test, 50% of the deaths occurred within the first seven days after the
positive test. However, randomized controlled treatment trials of SABI
have typically excluded the patients in the “early mortality” group,
resulting in an overall lower mortality rate in trials that may
inflate the effectiveness of the treatment and affect how clinicians
manage patients with SABI. This article analyzes studies reporting
SABI early mortality and specifically focuses on studies that
identified risk factors for early mortality. The findings support
standardization of the definition of early mortality as “all-cause
mortality within seven days of the first positive blood culture.”
However, studies that evaluated risk factors for early mortality were
not well designed. Future studies need to focus on improving the
design for identifying risk factors for early mortality of SABI to
develop interventions to potentially reduce the 30-day mortality of
this infection.

AB  - Abstract Background Rapid molecular diagnostic tests improve time to
organism identification and may expedite antimicrobial de-escalation.
Through faster detection of contaminated samples, rapid blood culture
identification (BCID) should also reduce unnecessary antibiotic use.
BioFire FilmArray BCID was implemented in July 2019 at a community
hospital. This study compared antimicrobial use for gram-positive
blood cultures before and after BCID implementation to identify areas
for further antimicrobial stewardship intervention. Methods This
retrospective cohort study evaluated adult patients at a 450-bed
community hospital with gram-positive blood culture results between
February and June 2018 and 2019 (pre-and post-BCID). Patients were
excluded for polymicrobial bacteremia, pregnancy, or
expiration/hospice status before blood culture positivity. The primary
outcome was time to optimal therapy (TTOT) for bacteremia, defined as
time to antimicrobial de-escalation, discontinuation, or result for
untreated contaminated cultures. Time to organism identification,
receipt of optimal therapy, and vancomycin duration were also
evaluated, in addition to subgroup analysis of contaminated cultures
(identified by microbiology comment or physician note). Results Of the
232 patients, median age was 70 years and 54.3% were male.
Coagulase-negative staphylococci was most commonly isolated (n=104,
45%) and contamination rate was 53.4%. Median TTOT improved from 53.3
vs 28 hours, p< 0.001 in pre- vs post-groups, respectively, and
optimal therapy selection increased from 83% to 93%, p=0.028. Median
time to organism identification was 60.2 vs 23.5 hours, p< 0.001.
Median duration for vancomycin (35.1 vs 25.2 hours, p=0.231) and
overall antimicrobial duration did not differ between groups. Among
contaminated blood cultures, TTOT improved (54 vs 27.3 hours, p<
0.001) and vancomycin median duration decreased (27.5 vs 16.6 hours,
p=0.253). Conclusion Rapid BCID significantly improved TTOT, resulting
in improved rates of optimal therapy and an observed reduced
vancomycin duration. High rates of contaminated blood cultures
identified opportunities for coordination with antimicrobial
stewardship to reduce contamination rates and improve antimicrobial
use. Disclosures All Authors: No reported disclosures.

AB  - To the Editor, In recent years, the ‘medical care consolidation’
phenomenon has resulted in centralized clinical microbiology
laboratories capable of providing services to patients who receive
care in remote locations [[1]Sautter R.L. Thomson Jr., R.B.
Consolidated clinical microbiology laboratories.J Clin Microbiol.
2015; 53: 1467-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar]. In
some cases, a ‘core’ microbiology laboratory is within a large
tertiary care hospital that serves smaller hospitals, whereas in other
cases it acts as a commercial reference laboratory for hospitals
outside of the parent organization [[1]Sautter R.L. Thomson Jr., R.B.
Consolidated clinical microbiology laboratories.J Clin Microbiol.
2015; 53: 1467-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar].
However, microbiology tests such as blood cultures (BCs)—in which the
turnaround time (TAT) from patient's blood collection to organism
identification (and susceptibility testing) results is critical to
patient care—should to be kept at the referring hospital site,
especially if the laboratory is open 24 h/day [[1]Sautter R.L. Thomson
Jr., R.B. Consolidated clinical microbiology laboratories.J Clin
Microbiol. 2015; 53: 1467-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google
Scholar]. As centralized hospital or free-standing service
laboratories may be distant hours from patient care locations
[[1]Sautter R.L. Thomson Jr., R.B. Consolidated clinical microbiology
laboratories.J Clin Microbiol. 2015; 53: 1467-1472Crossref PubMed
Scopus (31) Google Scholar], sample transportation times often exceed
the time-to-positivity of BCs, that is, the time from the start of
incubation (in a dedicated BC instrument) to a positive signal (by the
dedicated BC instrument). We analysed reporting of BC results at a
230-bed general hospital (namely, the Ospedale San Carlo GVM in Rome,
Italy) by comparing on-site (year 2018) and off-site (year 2017)
microbiology laboratory testing statuses. Starting from 2018, the
hospital laboratory collects and processes clinical samples for any
microbiological tests (including BCs) around the clock. Before 2018,
all the BCs were collected daily in the on-site (hospital) laboratory,
and transported by courier to an off-site (core) laboratory at either
2:30 p.m. (Monday through Friday) or 13:30 a.m. (Saturday). On
Sundays/holidays, BCs were collected and stored at room temperature in
the hospital laboratory until the courier service was in operation.
The times between BC collection and bottle loading (i.e., time to
load) ranged from ≤8 h to ≥48 h, which included the time between the
BC storage at, and delivery from, the hospital laboratory plus the
transportation time from the hospital laboratory to the core
laboratory. The latter was within the SYNLAB Group (www.synlab.com)
network of laboratories open 8 h/day from Monday to Friday and 6 h/day
on Saturday. Upon receipt at both the on-site and off-site
laboratories, BC bottles were immediately loaded into a BC automated
instrument (i.e. BACT/ALERT® 3D system, bioMérieux, Marcy l’Étoile,
France, or BACTEC™ FX system, Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD, USA) and
incubated for up to 5 days or until they signalled positive. At the
time bottles gave a positive signal, the BC broth's aliquots were
Gram-stained and cultured on standard agar plates to confirm
true-positive detection results (any organism, potential contaminants
included). At the end of the incubation period (i.e., 5 days), bottles
were discarded as negative. BC results from the core laboratory were
released online as soon as available to the hospital laboratory. Table
1 shows the distribution of the positive BCs, documenting
single-patient bloodstream infection episodes, as well the aetiology
of the episodes in the 2 years (2017 and 2018) under comparison. We
observed a difference of 3.1-fold in the number of BCs requested by
the wards' physicians between 2018 (n = 257) and 2017 (n = 82), as
well as an increase in the rate of BC positivity in 2018 compared to
2017: 73/257 (28.4%) versus 9/82 (11.0%) (p 0.001). Interestingly, the
mean (±SD) TAT for positive BCs was 4.0 (±1.5) days in 2018 versus 6.4
(±1.5) days in 2017 (p <0.001), whereas the TAT for negative BCs was
5.4 (±0.9) in 2018 versus 7.3 (±1.0) days in 2017 (p 0.01).
Consistently, the overall number of bloodstream infection episodes was
37 in 2018 and nine in 2017. Only in 2018, 12 episodes had a
multiple-species aetiology (i.e., were caused by more than one
bacterial species or by both bacterial and yeast species). Therefore,
there were 49 organisms (30 Gram-positives, 13 Gram-negatives and six
yeasts) identified in that year, compared to nine organisms (six
Gram-negatives and three Gram-positives) identified in 2017 (Table 1).
In 2018, the most prevalent organisms were coagulase-negative
staphylococci (18/49, 36.7%), followed by members of the
Enterobacteriales (11/49, 22.4%), enterococci (9/49, 18.4%) and yeasts
(6/49, 12.2%). In 2017, the number of BC demands equated the number of
organisms detected from positive BCs. We feel that knowing by the
wards' physicians that the patients' BCs were processed in an off-site
laboratory may have influenced their disposition in ordering BCs
during that year. However, we cannot exclude that a different case mix
between 2017 and 2018 may have been a potential bias leading to the
differences observed between the two periods of time.Table

support its effectiveness. This was a single-center retrospective
cohort study assessing the impact of the automated electronic ATO in
the setting of Gram-negative bacteremia. The primary outcome was the
proportion of patients who received a modification of therapy within
24 h of final culture results. Secondary outcomes included
modification at any point in therapy, time to modification of therapy,
time to de-escalation, and days of therapy of broad-spectrum
antibiotics. There was a total of 222 patients who met inclusion
criteria, 97 patients pre-ATO and 125 patients post-ATO. The primary
outcome of modification of therapy within 24 h of final culture
results was not significantly different (24% vs. 30%, p = 0.33). The
secondary outcome of modification of therapy at any point in therapy
was not significantly different between the two groups (65% vs. 67%, p
= 0.73). All other secondary outcomes were not significantly
different. The ATO alert was not associated with a higher rate of
antibiotic modification within 24 h of culture results in patients
with GNB. Further efforts are needed to optimize the ATO strategy and
antibiotic prescribing practices.

AB  - Abstract Background Time to appropriate antimicrobial therapy is the
most important predictor of survival among patients with sepsis due to
Gram-negative bacteria (GNB). Infections due to multidrug-resistant
(MDR) pathogens often result in inappropriate empiric treatment (tx).
The GenMark ePlex identifies organisms and resistance markers within
1.5 hours from blood culture positivity compared to 48-72 hours by
conventional methods. Methods We are conducting a single-center study
to assess outcomes before and after ePlex implementation. The
pre-intervention period included patients with GN bacteremia from
January to June 2021. Patients were excluded if they received
comfort-only care within 48 hours, had polymicrobial GN bacteremia, or
were infected by an organism not on the ePlex panel. Primary outcome
is time to in-vitro active therapy from blood culture collection.
Results 208 patients were identified during the pre-intervention
period; 154 met inclusion criteria. Median age was 64 years, 49% were
male, and 28% were immunocompromised. Median (IQR) Charlson
Comorbidity index and Pitt Bacteremia scores were 6 (4-8) and 2 (1-8),
respectively (Table 1). 16% of patients were infected by MDR GNB and
21% received inactive empiric tx. Overall median (IQR) time to
in-vitro active tx was 3.9 (1–19) hours, but was 39.5 (13.6-71.9)
hours among those who received inactive empiric tx. Median (IQR) time
to first antibiotic modification was 2.7 (1.0-3.4) days. 38% of
patients were transitioned to oral antibiotics at a median (IQR) of
4.2 (3.1-6.1) days. The median (IQR) duration of tx was 15 (10-17)
days; 4.5% of patients were treated with ≤ 7 days. Median (IQR) length
of hospitalization was 15.5 (7-36) days. 7.8% were re-admitted within
30 days (Table 2). In-hospital and 30-day mortality rates were
numerically higher among patients who received inactive empiric
therapy (27% and 21%, respectively) when compared to patients who
received active empiric therapy (16.5% and 12%, respectively) (Figure
1). Results Table 1: Patient demographics, underlying conditions and
infection and treatment characteristics in the pre-intervention group
Results Table 2 Results Figure 1 Conclusion Our pre-intervention data
highlight opportunities to improve the management of GN bacteremia.
Implementation of ePlex is likely to decrease the proportion of
patients treated with inactive therapy, shorten time to optimal tx and
reduce lengths of stay. Disclosures Ryan K. Shields, PharmD, MS,

AB  - Introduction Bloodstream infections occur commonly in the United
States and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality.
Bacteremia caused by gram-positive organisms has established
guidelines for the use of follow-up blood cultures (FUBCs), whereas
the use of FUBCs in bacteremia due to gram-negative bacilli (GNBs)
does not. One study showed that positive FUBCs were more common in
gram-positive coccus bacteremia (21%) than in GNB bacteremia (6%),
calling into question the overall clinical utility of using FUBCs in
GNB bacteremia. We investigated the factors associated with positive
FUBCs in patients with GNB bacteremia in our institution to better
guide clinical practice. Methods We used a case-control design for
this study. We included patients 18 years or older admitted to our
hospitals between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2018, for a
duration of ≥24 hours and who had a positive blood culture (BC) for
GNB. Cases were defined as any patient with a positive FUBC drawn ≥24
hours after the initial positive BC. Control subjects were defined as
patients with a negative FUBC after an initial positive BC.
Characteristics of cases and control subjects were compared using
descriptive statistics. A multivariable regression model using
stepwise variable selection was used to identify factors significantly
associated with having a positive FUBC. Results We identified 70 cases
meeting the inclusion criteria. We compared these 70 cases with 528
control subjects. The cases and control subjects did not differ
significantly in age, sex, race, or other predefined comorbid
conditions. Significant predictors for having a positive FUBC included
(1) organism resistance to initial antibiotic therapy (odds ratio
[OR], 3.26; P = 0.035), (2) glomerular filtration rate less than 30
mL/min (OR, 2.35; P = 0.010), (3) initial admission to critical care
unit (OR, 1.72; P = 0.049), (4) central line–associated infection (OR,
3.99; P = 0.004), (5) Klebsiella group infection (OR, 2.18; P =
0.015), and (6) Serratia marcescens infection (OR, 3.53; P = 0.037).
Initial discordant BC was a negative predictive factor (OR, 0.44; P =
0.018). Follow-up blood culture drawn more than 48 hours after the
initial positive BC had a lower likelihood of being positive than
those drawn 24 to 48 hours after the initial BC (OR, 0.59; P = 0.037).
Discussion We identified 6 independent risk factors for positive FUBCs
as delineated previously. These factors provide guidance for further
research and for future guideline development. The timing of the FUBCs
had a significant impact on positivity. Follow-up blood cultures in
GNB bacteremia should be obtained more than 48 hours after the initial
positive BC.

AB  - Abstract Background Bloodstream infections (BSI) are a major cause of
morbidity and mortality. Compared to traditional microbiology methods,
rapid diagnostic testing (RDT) provides prompt organism identification
and antibiotic susceptibility results. This leads to earlier
opportunities to optimize therapy, which may improve patient outcomes.
Methods This was a single center quasi-experimental study of
hospitalized adults with Gram-negative (GN) BSI, comparing the
management and outcomes across three periods: pre-RDT (traditional
identification and susceptibilities with BD Phoenix®, December 2014 to
September 2016), RDT1 (Nanosphere Verigene®, December 2016 to December
2019), and RDT2 (Accelerate Pheno™, February 2020 to September 2021).
The primary outcome was time to optimal therapy (TTOT). Secondary
outcomes included time to oral antibiotic step-down, hospital length
of stay (LOS), incidence of Clostridioides difficile infection, and
30-day inpatient mortality. Chi-squared and Kruskal-Wallis tests were
used to compare categorical and continuous variables. Significance
values for the primary endpoint were adjusted with Bonferroni
correction to account for multiple pairwise comparisons. Results Of
296 included patients, 100 were in the pre-RDT, 98 in the RDT1, and 98
in the RDT2 arms. The most common organisms were Escherichia coli
(64.5%) and Klebsiella species (20.3%). The TTOT (median,
interquartile range) in the pre-RDT, RDT1, and RDT2 groups were 46
(7-61), 30 (0-53), and 12 (0-28) hours (P< 0.001), respectively. The
time to oral antibiotic step-down and hospital LOS was similar between
groups. There was no difference in C. difficile infection or 30-day
inpatient mortality (Table 1). Table 1. Comparison of Outcomes
Conclusion In patients with GN BSI the TTOT in RDT1 was shorter when
compared to traditional susceptibility methods. Compared to both rapid
identification alone and traditional identification and susceptibility
methods, RDT2 improved time to optimal therapy. Larger, controlled
studies are needed to examine the clinical impact of different RDT
methods for Gram negative bloodstream infections. Disclosures Rachel

AB  - Abstract Background Treatment strategies surrounding bacteremia are
constantly changing as new data emerges. Transition from intravenous
(IV) to oral (PO) antibiotics in patients with Gram-negative rod
bloodstream infections (GNR BSI) remains controversial. The objective
of this study was to characterize clinical outcomes in patients who
received early (≤72 hours) vs. late (>72 hours) stepdown therapy (ES
vs. LS, respectively) for GNR BSIs. Methods A single-center,
retrospective cohort study was conducted including adults with GNR
BSIs admitted to a 610-bed tertiary care academic medical center
between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2017 who were transitioned
from IV to PO antibiotics. Patients with severe renal impairment,
inadequate source control, prolonged antibiotic course, HIV/AIDS, and
pregnancy were excluded. The primary endpoint was clinical failure and
secondary endpoints were 30- and 90-day all-cause mortality, duration
of bacteremia, and adverse events. Results 164 patients (ES = 61; NS =
103) were included. Population median age was 63 years, 56% were male,
and 19% were immunocompromised. Genitourinary source was most common
(48.7%), while the most common organism isolated was Escherichia coli
(52.4%). Most infections were community-acquired (70.1%) and the most
common step-down therapy choice was ciprofloxacin in 75% of patients.
There were no major differences in baseline demographic and clinical
characteristics between groups except for the greater presence of
central venous catheters (16.4% vs. 35.9%; P = 0.006) in the LS group.
Overall clinical failure was 9.8% vs. 13.6% between the ES and LS
groups, respectively. The LS group had a higher rate of clinical
failure defined by escalation from PO to IV antibiotics (1.6% vs.
10.7%; P = 0.03). Patients who failed therapy tended to be
immunocompromised and/or have an intra-abdominal source of infection.
Secondary endpoints did not differ between groups. Conclusion Higher
clinical failure rates in the LS group indicate that these patients
may have underlying clinical characteristics not amenable to stepdown
therapy. Choice of step-down therapy was not driven by the source of
infection or patient acuity. Further analysis and studies are needed
to determine optimal time and population for stepdown. Disclosures All

AB  - Abstract Background Morbidity from bacteremia may be exacerbated by
inadequate initial antibiotic therapy. This concern however may lead
to hesitance to de-escalate while awaiting pathogen identification and
susceptibility results. We performed a randomized controlled trial
evaluating the impact of a strategy for rapid pathogen and resistance
detection directly from positive blood culture bottles (BCBs) using a
rapid multiplex PCR (rmPCR) complemented with a rapid phenotypic
screen (RPS) for extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and carbapenemases
in a setting with moderate to high levels of antimicrobial resistance
where routine direct-from-BCB disk diffusion susceptibility testing
was in place Methods Patients with positive BCBs were randomized to 2
arms: 1) Standard BCB processing (including direct from BCB disk
diffusion susceptibility testing - control, n=419) with antimicrobial
stewardship (AS); or 2) rmPCR/RPS with AS (rmPCR/RPS, n=425). The
primary outcome was time from positive blood culture result to
prescription of an effective or optimal antibiotic regimen. An
effective antibiotic regimen was defined as one active against the
detected pathogen(s); an optimal antibiotic regimen was defined as an
effective regimen which was also the most narrow spectrum and targeted
one, as recommended by institutional guidelines. Mortality was
analyzed as a secondary outcome. Results True bacteremia was
identified in 658 patients (n=329 in both arms); 597 were
monomicrobial (405 with aerobic or facultative anaerobic Gram
negatives rods [AGNR]) and 61 polymicrobial (41 harboring AGNR). Time
from BCB Gram stain to prescription of an effective antibiotic was 9.9
versus 3.2 hours in the control and rmPCR/RPS groups, respectively
(p=0.58) and time from Gram stain to prescription of an optimal
antibiotic regimen was 41.6 versus 29.4 hours in the two groups,
respectively (p < 0.001). 14-day mortality was 7.6% versus 4.3% (p =
0.069) and 30-day mortality was 11.2% versus 8.8% (p=0.30) in the two
groups, respectively. Conclusion Compared to control methods which
included direct-from-BCB disk diffusion susceptibility testing, an
intervention comprising rmPCR/RPS with AS applied to positive blood
cultures improved time to optimal therapy but not time to effective
therapy or mortality. Disclosures Shawn Vasoo, MBBS, MRCP, D(ABP),

AB  - Background: Emerging antibacterial resistance is a constant threat.
Broad-spectrum antibiotics are preferred in empirical treatment for
bloodstream infections (BSI) due to increasing resistance rates.
METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted in three
tertiary hospitals in Türkiye. Microbiologically documented BSIs were
collected between 1 November 2023 and 1 June 2024. Demographics,
clinical information, and antimicrobial susceptibility tests for each
BSI case were collected. RESULTS: A total of 618 BSI patients were
included in the study and 55 (8.9%) of these BSIs were polymicrobial.
Among 563 monomicrobial BSIs, the causative agent was gram-negative in
278 (49.4%), gram-positive in 247 (43.9%), and Candida spp. in 38
(6.7%) patients. Gram-positive and gram-negative species distribution
is depicted in Figure 1 and 2, respectively. Methicillin-resistant S.
aureus (MRSA) rate was 37%. Carbapenem resistance rate for K.
pneumoniae was 62%. 30-day mortality was 48% in gram-negative BSI, and
it was 66% if the causative agent is carbapenem resistant. BSI caused
by MRSA had a 30-day mortality of 36%. The two most common empirical
treatment choices were meropenem and piperacillin-tazobactam. Of
patients receiving ineffective empirical treatment, 35% failed
escalation in 24 hours after susceptibility results. More than 24-hour
delay in de-escalation of meropenem was observed in 82% of
gram-negative BSIs. Escalation in 24 hours was achieved in MRSA BSIs.
Mean delay of 3.9 days were observed in de-escalation of vancomycin or
teicoplanin in methicillin-susceptible S. aureus BSIs. CONCLUSION:
Timely transition to targeted therapies is critical for antimicrobial
stewardship especially when broad-spectrum antibiotics are preferred
in empirical therapy.

AB  - The optimal time cut-off for appropriate antibiotic therapy (AAT) in
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia remains
uncertain. We assessed the effects of time to AAT on 30-day
in-hospital mortality in patients with MRSA bacteremia who received
glycopeptides as initial therapy, and applied landmark analyses to
adjust for immortal-time bias. We conducted a retrospective cohort
study of adults with MRSA bacteremia who received an initial course of
glycopeptide therapy at two university-affiliated hospitals between
2018 and 2023. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify
covariates. These covariates were then included in six separate
landmark models that assessed the effect of AAT within pre-specified
cut-off time of 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h after the index blood
culture collection. Among 220 patients, osteoarticular infections were
the focus of bacteremia in 25.5%, and septic shock occurred as a
complication in 28.2%; 30-day in-hospital mortality was 24.1%.
Vancomycin was administered as initial therapy in 63.2% of patients,
and the median time to glycopeptide initiation was 36 h (interquartile
range, 19–67.5). Metastatic solid tumor, initial septic shock,
pneumonia, and unknown focus were independent risk factors for death
according to multivariable analysis. After covariate adjustment,
glycopeptide therapy administered within any of the six pre-defined
cut-off time was not significantly associated with mortality. No
significant time cut-off for glycopeptide initiation was associated
with increased mortality. In patients without septic shock or other
mortality-related risk factors, a modest delay in AAT may have slight
effect on outcomes.

AB  - Abstract Background The deleterious outcomes associated with delay
receipt of appropriate therapy are well documented. However, scant
data exists on the consequences of each day delay of appropriate
therapy and subsequent outcomes among adult hospitalized patients with
GN-BSIs. Methods Study design: a retrospective cohort analysis. Study
population: consecutive adult, hospitalized patients with a GN-BSI (11
most prevalent pathogens) in 1 of 181 institutions contributing
microbiology data to the Premier Healthcare Database (October 2010–Sep
2015). Exclusion criteria: age < 18 years; diagnosis of pregnancy or
cystic fibrosis, died or discharged within 2 days of index GN-BSI
culture, lack of sufficient antibiotic susceptibility or treatment
data to determine appropriateness. Day of initiating appropriate
therapy was defined as the first day when the patient received an
antibiotic with in vitro activity against the GN-BSI post index
culture. Results were summarized by Kaplan–Meier estimates, and Cox
Proportional-Hazards (CPH) analyses modeling discharge to home were
conducted. Time to initiate appropriate therapy (0, 1–2 days, 3–4
days, ≥5 days) was included in the CPH model as an ordinal variable.
Results A total of 40,549 patients met selection criteria. Mean (SD)
age was 67.5 (16.1) years and 54% were female. E. coli and K.
pneumoniae were the most common GN-BSI (58.0% and 18.3%,
respectively). Approximately 30% of patients were in the ICU at index
GN-BSI and in-hospital mortality was 6.8%. The mean (SD) time to
receive appropriate therapy post index GN-BSI culture was 0.6 (2.7)
days, and 69.7%, 22.5%, 5.7% and 2.1% received appropriate therapy in
0, 1–2, 3–4, and ≥5 days of index GN-BSI, respectively. The
mean/median LOS post index GN-BSI by 0, 1–2, 3–4, and ≥5 days delays
in appropriate treatment were 8.3/6, 9.8/7, 11.5/8, and 19.2/11 days
respectively. Kaplan–Meier plots are shown in Figure 1. In the CPH
model, each interval delay in appropriate therapy was associated with
a 21% decrease in the likelihood of being discharged home for patients
with GB-BSIs. Conclusion Hospital length of stay was found to increase
when appropriate therapy was delayed. These findings highlight the
critical need for early appropriate therapy among patients with
GN-BSIs. Disclosures All authors: No reported disclosures.

AB  - Abstract Background Imbalance among innate mediators such as IL-1β,
IL-10, and TNF-α portends poor outcomes of persistence and death in
patients with SAB. Previous studies did not consider the role of
antibiotic treatment in this important host–pathogen relationship. In
this study of SAB, we determined cytokine signatures that correlate
with the composite endpoint of clinical failure (bacteremia duration
>4 days or 30-day mortality) in Australian patients treated with FLU
or VAN. Methods Sera from 86 patients with SAB (24.4% MRSA) were
obtained from a clinical study of patients treated with FLU or VAN.
All of the patient samples were collected at clinical presentation
(day 0 or day 1 of infection) and were treated with FLU or VAN
throughout. Patients were classified into either clinical success (CS
= 68) or clinical failure (CF = 18), defined as death or prolonged
bacteremia >4 days. Patient demographic and infection characteristics
were collected. A 10-multiplex TH1/TH2 cytokine analysis was performed
using electrochemoluminescence with the Meso-Scale Discovery platform
analyzed by Mann–Whitney U. Results Patients’ median values were
significantly elevated and above the normal range in CF for IL-1β (P =
0.029), IL-10 (P = 0.018), TNF-α (P = 0.042), and IL-6 (P = 0.006)
(figure). Epidural abscess source was associated with CF, but no other
host or pathogen characteristics correlated to outcome. Patients
infected with isolates with VAN MIC = 2 mg/L (by Etest and broth
dilution) had lower concentrations of IL-1β and IL-10 (P = 1.5 mg/L.
In ROC analysis, IL-1β, IL-10, TNF, and IL-6 were higher sensitivity
and specificity predictors of CF (AUC 0.65–0.71; P = 0.05). Conclusion
A suboptimal host immune response to SAB at presentation predicts
adverse clinical outcomes. IL-10, TNF-α, and IL-6 serum concentrations
appear to reflect immunopathology in patients with SAB. These
predictive markers may be considered in therapeutic clinical
decision-making, such as escalation of alternative therapies in
high-risk patients and/or de-escalation treatment in low-risk
patients. These data offer steps toward further refining therapeutic
precision for patients with SAB beyond the standard clinical or
microbiological metrics that are employed in current practice.

AB  - As infecções de corrente sanguínea (ICS) são frequentes em pacientes
em tratamento para doenças onco-hematológicas, em especial os
neutropenicos febris. A realização de hemoculturas é essencial para a
definição diagnóstica e ajuste de terapêutica, com o intuito de
reduzir mortalidade e otimizar uso de antimicrobianos. A automação do
processo trouxe agilidade para o resultado parcial e possibilita a
mensuração do tempo para positivação (TPP). Neste estudo analisamos o
TPP de hemoculturas coletadas em uma população de pacientes
hospitalizados em tratamento de doenças onco-hematológicas e/ou
submetidos a transplante de medula óssea (TMO). Trata-se de coorte
prospectiva de pacientes com doenças onco-hematológicas
hospitalizados, entre o período de 2020 a 2021, incluindo pacientes
submetidos a TMO autólogo e alogenico. Foram revistas as hemoculturas
coletadas no período. Os eventos foram classificados em infecção de
corrente sanguínea (ICS), e excluídas culturas consideradas com
contaminação de coleta (identificação de agente colonizante de pele em
apenas uma amostra). Definiu-se o TPP o tempo entre a admissão ao
laboratório e a positivação do meio. Na rotina coleta-se frascos de
hemocultura aeróbio e anaeróbio do sangue periférico e das vias do
cateter venoso central. Considerou-se para esta análise o TTP do
frasco que obteve a positivação mais rápida. Comparou-se o TTP entre
diferentes tipos de ICS: por agentes Gram-negativos (GN),
Gram-positivos (GP) e candidemias, e a presença de agente GN
multirresistente (produção de ESBL ou resistência a carbapenema). No
decorrer do estudo foram analisados um total de 133 ICS, sendo 65
(49%) em portadores de leucemia aguda (49%) e 103 (77%) em pacientes
submetidos a TMO. Um total de 124 ICS por agente único e nove
polimicrobianas. Gram negativos (GN), Gram positivos (GP) e
candidemias foram 75 (60%), 50 (40%) e 8 (6%), respectivamente. O
tempo mediano de positivação foi de 28 horas (variando de 1 a 77
horas), sendo em 47 (35%) dos eventos menor que 24 horas, 71 (53%)
entre 24 e 48h e em 11 (8%) entre 48 e 72h, respectivamente. A mediana
do TPP nas ICS por GN foi 25 horas vs. 32h nas GP e 33h nas
candidemias (p = 0.013). TPP < 48 horas foi identificado em 88% das
ICS por BGN, 89% das ICS por CGP e 100% das candidemias. O tipo de
frasco primeiro positivar sofreu influência dos diferentes tipos de
ICS. Nas candidemias, o frasco de aeróbio foi o mais rápido (p =
0.03). Nas ICS por enterobactérias, o menor TPP foi mais frequente nos
frascos de anaeróbio (p = 0.01). Em relação ao local de coleta (sangue
periférico vs. cateter), não houve diferença. Dentre as 21 ICS por GN
MDR, não houve diferença no TPP comparando GN MDR vs. GN não MDR (23h
vs. 23h; p = NS) e todas ICS por GNMDR tiveram TPP <48h. Conclui-se
que em cerca de 90% das ICS o TPP foi menor que 48h. Não houve ICS por
GN MDR com TPP > 48h. Houve benefício na coleta pareada (aeróbio e
anaeróbio), e a coleta via cateter não foi inferior em relação a
periférica para o desfecho analisado. O TPP mostrou-se uma ferramenta
de uso prático para adequação de condutas antimicrobianas empíricas
nesta população hematológica de alto risco.

AB  - Abstract Background Blood stream infection (BSI) during neutropenia is
associated with high risk for morbidity and mortality in patients with
hematologic malignancies receiving chemotherapy or undergoing
hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT). We sought to identify factors
associated with increased risk for critical illness (CI) morbidities
within 7 days of BSI with index FN following chemotherapy. Methods A
prospective ongoing survey among 14 high-volume US cancer centers
submitting clinical and microbiologic data from consecutive HM
patients with blood stream infection (BSI) during first FN after
cytotoxic chemotherapy or HCT. We evaluated factors influencing poor
outcomes defined as critical illness (need for pressor support,
mechanical ventilation, new pneumonia or new BSI) within 7 days of BSI
with index FN. Concordance between antibiotic and BSI isolate was
determined by investigator (AZ, AF) interpretation of susceptibility
reports provided by each center compared with the initial
antimicrobial regimen (IAR) used, for single organism bacteremias
only. Results Among 294 FN bacteremic episodes (93 HCT) were 336
bacterial pathogens (48.5% Gram-negative [GN], 46.5% Gram-positive
[GP], and 6% anaerobes). Death occurred in 11/294 (4%) and 41/294
(14%) had CI by day 8. At FN presentation, mean MASCC score of those
with CI vs. those without was 16.9 vs. 18.6 (P = 0.03) and there was a
trend toward higher mean PITT scores for patients with CI by day 8 vs.
those without (1.54 vs. 0.82 (P = 0.08)). Among GN bacteremias, 15%
developed CI vs. 14.5% in nonviridans group Streptococci (VGS) GP
bacteremias, and 10.9% in VGS bacteremias (NS). Among patients with
single organism bacteremias (88% of all BSI), mismatch of IAR coverage
with isolate susceptibilities occurred in 16.7% (38/227). Among
patients whom IAR was active vs. inactive against BSI isolate, 16% vs
14.3%, respectively, developed CI (P = 0.81). Conclusion These data
indicate that the MASCC score applied to high-risk inpatients may be a
predictor for CI in the first week after bacteremia FN. The PITT shows
less correlation with poor outcomes. There was no association between
isolate type (GN, GP, or VGS) and CI. Notably there was no association
between mismatched BSI susceptibility and antimicrobial spectrum of
the IAR and early CI. Disclosures A. G. Freifeld, Merck: Investigator,

AB  - Abstract Background Prior studies have suggested that surveillance
blood cultures (SBCs) may not be indicated in the setting of
Gram-negative bacteremia (GNB). However, it is unclear how particular
microbial species influence the need for SBCs in GNB. Methods We
conducted a prospective cohort study of inpatients at Duke with
Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) and GNB from 2002–2015.
Patients who died <24 hours from the first positive blood culture were
excluded. Patients provided written informed consent. SBCs were
defined as a blood culture drawn from 24 hours to 7 days from initial
positive blood culture. Persistent bacteremia was defined as a
positive SBC with the same organism. Statistical testing included
Fishers exact and chi-square tests. Results There were 2856 episodes
of bacteremia over the study period (SAB: 1,147 [40%]; GNB: 1,709
[60%]). SBCs were drawn in 87% (1,003/1,147) of SAB patients and 64%
(1,097/1,709) of GNB patients. SBC rates varied by GNB species (P <
0.001), being more commonly drawn for those patients with Pseudomonas
bacteremia (128/159 [80%]) than those with Escherichia bacteremia
(377/592 [62%]). In GNB, acquisition of SBCs, regardless of
positivity, was associated with decreased in-hospital mortality
(177/1,173 [15%] vs. 109/536 [20%]; P = 0.008). The in-hospital
mortality benefit associated with SBCs varied with GNB species,
including Pseudomonas (30/128 [23%] vs. 14/31 [45%]; P = 0.02) and
Escherichia (33/377 [9%] vs. 37/215 [17%]; P = 0.003). In-hospital
mortality in those with SAB was also lower when SBCs were drawn
(143/1003 [14%] vs. 46/144 [32%]; P = 0.0001) (figure). In GNB,
positive SBCs, relative to negative SBCs, was associated with
increased in-hospital mortality (44/217 [20%] vs. 133/956 [14%]; P =
0.02). Persistent bacteremia occurred in 49% (494/1003) of SAB
patients and 20% (217/1097) of GNB patients with SBCs. Persistent
bacteremia risk differed by GNB species (P = 0.004), and was highest
among those with Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (9/19 [47%]) or Serratia
(24/76 [31%]). Conclusion Acquisition of SBCs in patients with GNB was
associated with decreased mortality, and this was driven in part by
species-specific differences. Disclosures D. Van Duin, achaogen:

AB  - Background: Considering the difficulties and ethical concerns to
conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing early appropriate
antimicrobial treatment (<24h) versus late initiation of appropriate
therapy (24-72h) in Gram-negative bacterial (GNB) infections, we
conducted a target trial emulation framework to appreciate the casual
effect of early appropriate antimicrobial treatment (EAT) compared to
late initiation of appropriate therapy (LAT) on clinical outcomes in
patients with hospital-acquired monobacterial Gram-negative blood
stream infection (BSI). Method: The emulated trial included
individuals recruited in a prospective cohort of adult patients from
22 Turkish hospitals between September 2021-December 2022. Data
pertaining to eligibility criteria, treatment strategies, treatment
assignments, follow-up, outcomes, and statistical analysis are shown
in Table 1. RESULTS: 378 individuals were included (mean age, 59.5 ±
17.7 years; 65 % males). Most frequent sources of infection included
pneumonia (21.2%) and central venous catheters (13.8%). 54.2% were
treated in ICU at the onset of the BSI with a mean SOFA score of 6.1 ±
4.2. Difficult-to-treat resistance was present in 24.6% of the
causative pathogens. The 28-day mortality rate was 26.1% in the EAT
group vs 40.6% in 24-72h group. Table 2 shows the results of inverse
probability treatment weighting-adjusted analysis of main analysis
population and those of subgroup analyses comparing clinical outcomes
in very EAT (<6h) vs those initiated beyond 6 hours of the onset of
BSI. CONCLUSIONS: Both EAT and very EAT compared to LAT reduced the
risk of mortality but had no significant effect on clinical cure in
BSIs caused by monobacterial GNB.

AB  - Introduction: Methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) is
implicated in blood stream infections with high morbidity and
mortality. Targeted treatment (TT) with nafcillin or cefazolin is
considered first-line therapy, however patients may receive broad
spectrum therapy for MSSA bacteremia for various reasons. We
hypothesize non-targeted beta-lactams (NT) are less effective for
blood culture clearance compared to TT for MSSA bacteremia. Methods:
Critically ill patients >18 years old with an MSSA positive blood
culture between 7/1/2014 and 12/31/2020 were included. Patients were
identified retrospectively through the electronic medical record and
must have received either a NT (ampicillin/sulbactam, ceftriaxone,
cefepime, piperacillin/tazobactam, meropenem) or TT. The TT cohort
included the receipt of or de-escalation to nafcillin or cefazolin
within 72 hours of antibiotic initiation. Patients with lack of
follow-up blood cultures, death, or discharge within 48 hours of
positive culture were excluded. Patients were matched according to
age, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), presence of a central line, and
source of bacteremia. The primary outcome was duration of bacteremia.
Secondary outcomes included hospital and intensive care unit (ICU)
length of stay (LOS) and inpatient mortality. Results: Of 423
patients, 178 were included based on matching criteria. The majority
of patients were male (63%) and Caucasian (92%) with a median age of
56 (interquartile range [IQR], 47-65). Median CCI was 5 in both groups
(IQR, 3-8). The most frequent NT were piperacillin/tazobactam (56%)
and cefepime (34%). There was no significant difference in duration of
bacteremia (3.4 vs 3.4 days, p=0.653), hospital LOS (18.9 vs 26.4
days, p=0.071), or ICU LOS (5.3 vs 5.9 days, p=0.966) in the TT vs NT
cohorts, respectively. Patients in the TT cohort had significantly
lower mortality compared to those in the NT cohort (12.4% vs 24.7%,
p=0.034). Conclusions: ICU patients who received TT or NT had similar
duration of bacteremia, hospital LOS, and ICU LOS. Exposure to NT was
associated with increased mortality. Although these results should be
validated prospectively, clinicians should be cognizant of this risk
when evaluating those with MSSA bacteremia and consider de-escalation
to TT as soon as clinically appropriate.

AB  - Abstract Background Importance of follow up blood cultures (FUBC) for
Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections (BSI) is well known, but
the role of FUBC in gram-negative BSI remains controversial. This
retrospective cohort study examined the association between obtaining
FUBC and mortality in patients with gram-negative BSI. Methods Adults
with first episodes of community-onset monomicrobial BSI due to
gram-negative bacilli hospitalized at Prisma Health-Midlands hospitals
in Columbia, South Carolina, USA from January 1, 2010 to June 30, 2015
were identified. Patients who died or were discharged from hospital
within 72 hours of collection of index blood culture were excluded to
minimize impact of survival and selection biases on results,
respectively. FUBC were defined as repeat blood cultures obtained
between 24 and 96 hours from initial positive blood culture. Cox
proportional hazards regression model was used to examine association
between obtaining FUBC and 28-day all-cause mortality. Results Among
766 patients with gram-negative BSI, 219 (28.6%) had FUBC obtained and
15 of 219 (6.8%) FUBC were persistently positive. Overall, median age
was 67 years, 438 (57%) were women, 457 (60%) had urinary source of
infection, and 426 (56%) had BSI due to Escherichia coli. Mortality
was significantly lower in patients who had FUBC obtained than in
those who did not have FUBC (6.3% vs. 11.7%, log-rank p=0.03).
Obtaining FUBC was independently associated with reduced mortality
(hazards ratio [HR] 0.49, 95%CI: 0.25–0.90) after adjustments for age
(HR 1.35 per decade, 95% CI: 1.13–1.61), cancer (HR 5.90, 95% CI:
3.53–9.84), Pitt bacteremia score (HR 1.38 per point, 95% CI:
1.26–1.50), and inappropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy (HR
2.37, 95% CI: 1.17–4.39). Conclusion Obtaining FUBC was associated
with improved survival in hospitalized patients with gram-negative
BSI. These observations are consistent with the results of recent
publications from Italy and North Carolina supporting utilization of
FUBC in the management of gram-negative BSI. Disclosures Julie Ann

AB  - Background and Objective Polymicrobial bloodstream infections (PBSI)
in hospitalized patients are associated with increased mortality,
while few studies have characterized the clinical features in this
population. This study aimed to assess the risk factors and short-term
prognosis of PBSI in hospitalized patients.Materials and Methods 4066
patients with culture-positive blood were included between January 1,
2015 and December 31, 2017 in the First Affiliated Hospital of
Zhejiang University School of Medicine (Hangzhou, China) in our study.
218 patients were diagnosed as PBSI. The patients were divided into
two groups according to the outcome after 30-day follow-up. The number
of survival group were 129, while the number of non-survival group
were 89. The clinical data, identified microorganisms and severity
models were compared between the two groups. A cox regression model
was used to identify the risk factors of 30-day mortality in PBSI
patients. Five prediction models were compared by Z-test to test the
value of these models to predict outcome of PBSI.Results The patients
in the non-survival group were more likely to receive inappropriate
antibiotic therapy at the time of PBSI and showed more severe in
systemic inflammatory. They were more likely to develop to be septic
shock and to be admitted in ICU than the patients in the survival
group. Inappropriate initial empirical antimicrobial therapy (HR=1.713
95% CI: 1.063-2.760, p=0.027), white blood cell (HR=1.740 95% CI:
1.002-3.020, p=0.049) and platelet (HR=2.940 95% CI: 1.754-4.930,
p<0.001) were independent risk factors for 30-day mortality in PBSI
patients. SOFA (AUROC=0.882, 95% CI=0.832-0.922) scores was a good
prognostic scoring system for predicting short-term mortality in PBSI
patients. The SOFA score was more valuable than the other four models
in predicting the outcome of PBSI according to the Z-test
(p<0.05).Discussion and Conclusions Inappropriate initial empirical
antimicrobial therapy, white blood cell and platelet were closely
associated with short-term mortality.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Infections remain the primary source of
complications and mortality in the burn population. Over the years
there have been many updates to the infection prevention efforts as
well as reimbursement for hospital acquired infections (HAIs).
However, the burn patient remains a high-risk population. This
population is often excluded from the data collection to form the
definitions of HAIs like central-line associated blood stream
infections (CLABSIs), yet these definitions do not consider the unique
characteristics of this population. We sought to determine the
characteristics of patients with bacteremia at our institution to help
drive improvements in defining and preventing these life-threatening
infections. Methods Patients were identified using the Institutional
Burn Center registry and linked to the clinical and administrative
data. All adult patients admitted to the BICU with >10% TBSA burn
between July 1, 2014, to June 30, 2024, were included. Demographics,
length of stay (LOS), co-morbid conditions, and mortality were
evaluated. Results There was a total of 135 patients over the 10-year
period with positive blood cultures. The patients were majority male
70.4%, average age was 50.8 years, average TBSA was 31.7%, 82.2% were
flame burns. The average length of stay (LOS) was 93.5 days with an
average ICU LOS of 56.1 days. The average for ventilator days was
51.7, average number of operative interventions was 4.8. The average
days from admit to first positive blood culture was 26.0 days. Of
these patients, 83.7% had a central line, 46.7% had renal failure, and
40.7% met the definition of multisystem organ failure (MSOF). Organism
were stratified into gram-positive, gram-negative, and yeast/mold as
causative agents. When stratified by organism, patients with
yeast/mold had higher incidence of MSOF (p< 0.05) but mortality did
not reach statistical significance. Conclusions There continues to be
a mismatch between the definition of and prevention measures available
for the burn population. We note that many of our patients with
bacteremia were male with flame injuries. Flame injuries and resultant
contact to the environment during extinguishing maneuvers
(stop-drop-roll, water hose, etc) can expose our patients to a variety
of contaminants that we are unable to predict or plan for. Considering
this exposure at time of admission and adjusting our prevention may
improve outcomes. Additionally, adjusting definitions of these events
may be necessary in terms of reimbursement and mortality indicators.
Applicability of Research to Practice This study reinforces the need
for additional considerations of the criteria for HAIs in burn
patients. This population has unique characteristics that fall outside
the typical standards that may necessitate updates to definitions.

AB  - Abstract Background It is not clear if follow-up blood cultures are
beneficial in patients with Gram-negative bacteremia. It may improve
clinical outcomes but have some drawbacks such as the possibility of
inaccurate positive findings and extending the length of hospital stay
and duration of antibiotic therapy. The aim of this meta-analysis was
to evaluate the impact of follow-up blood cultures on mortality in
patients with Gram-negative bacteremia. Methods PubMed and EMBASE
databases were searched from inception to Jan 2023 for randomized
controlled trials or observational studies comparing the mortality in
patients with Gram-negative bacteremia who had follow-up blood
cultures obtained versus those without these cultures. We estimated
odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using
random-effects models and assessed for heterogeneity (I2). Results A
total of six observational studies were included, while no randomized
controlled trials were identified. The total number of patients was
4,631. One study used 28-day mortality, two studies used 30-day
mortality, and three studies used in-hospital mortality. Follow-up
blood cultures were associated with significantly lower odds of
mortality ((OR, 0.6; 95%CI, 0.5-0.7; I2, 0%). No publication bias or
heterogeneity was observed. Conclusion The use of follow-up blood
cultures in patients with Gram-negative bacteremia was associated with
lower mortality. Randomized controlled trials are needed. Currently,
follow-up blood cultures should be obtained for at least the high-risk
patients with Gram-negative bacteremia. Disclosures Khalid Eljaaly,

AB  - Abstract Background Rapid diagnostic testing in combination with
real-time antimicrobial stewardship intervention can reduce time to
de-escalation of empiric antibiotics and discontinuation of
unnecessary therapy. This study aims to evaluate the clinical impact
of Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass
Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) for Gram-positive organism identification
for blood cultures across a healthcare system comprised of pediatric,
adult academic, and adult community hospitals utilizing a central
microbiology laboratory with unique antimicrobial stewardship
resources at each site. Methods This multicenter retrospective study
compared patients with a positive blood culture for a Gram-positive
organism identified via MALDI-TOF MS to a historical cohort identified
using conventional methods. Primary outcome was time to optimal
therapy (TTOT). Secondary outcomes included time to effective therapy,
duration of therapy, time to microbiologic clearance, hospital length
of stay (LOS), ICU LOS, recurrence, readmission, in-hospital
mortality, and all-cause mortality. Results This study included 129
cultures (12% pediatric patients) in the conventional period and 129
cultures (19% pediatric patients) in the MALDI-TOF MS group. Of the
total 258 blood cultures included, 147 (57%) represented true
bloodstream infection and 111 (43%) were deemed to be contaminants.
Despite a median reduction in time to organism identification (60.0
vs. 45.4 hours, P < 0.001), there was no difference in the primary
outcome of overall median TTOT between the two groups (70.7 hours vs.
65.9 hours, P = 0.407). There were no significant differences for any
secondary outcomes. Overall TTOT was longer as distance from the
central laboratory increased (47.3 hours at central site vs. 76.9
hours at distance >30 miles). Among contaminants, median TTOT was
reduced from 72.5 hours with conventional methods to 59.8 hours with
MALDI-TOF MS (P = 0.015). Conclusion. Implementation of MALDI-TOF MS
for organism identification may not reduce time to optimal therapy in
patients with true Gram-positive bacteremia. However, it can result in
a significant reduction in time to discontinuation of unnecessary
therapy for patients with contaminated cultures. Figure 1. Differences

AB  - Common operational definitions of antibiotic exposures in infectious
diseases research do not accurately reflect actual treatment, as daily
changes in clinical presentation (i.e. improvement, worsening) and
clinical information (i.e. causative organism, susceptibilities) lead
to frequent changes in treatment, both within empiric and definitive
treatment periods. Common definitions create periods of ‘ignored’
exposures, and we’ve previously shown that antibiotic treatments
during ‘ignored’ periods vary widely. Therefore, we assessed the
distribution of important time points for antibiotic treatments for
Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia.

Our retrospective cohort study included hospital admissions in the
national Veterans Affairs (VA) Healthcare System with S. aureus
positive blood cultures from 2010 to 2018. Admissions with
inappropriate initial antibiotic therapy for S. aureus were excluded.
We implemented daily exposure mapping to identify antibiotic exposures
and changes in treatment on each day of the admission until discharge,
or 30 days post-admission for longer stays, and in relation to the
culture final report date.

We identified 21,947 admissions meeting our inclusion criteria.
Antibiotic initiation most often occurred on the culture collection
date (68.7%) or the day after (22.6%). Median time to the culture
final report date from the culture collection date was 4 days
(interquartile range [IQR] 3 to 5). Among those with changes in
therapy (n=19,392, 88.4%), median time to first change in therapy was
2 days prior to the culture final report date (IQR -3 to -1). The
first change in therapy occurred before the culture final report date
for 76.3% of admissions and on the culture final report date for 11.9%
of admissions. Further changes were common on the culture final report
date (49.5%) and the day after the final report date (45.3%).

Changes in antibiotic therapy are common prior to finalization of
culture reports. While initial culture results and provider knowledge
of these initial results are not date/time-stamped, initial change
within a reasonable period from culture collection appears to be more
accurate in defining empiric and definitive treatment periods than
commonly used operational definitions.

AB  - Bacteremia is a clinically significant condition due to its potential
to rapidly progress to sepsis, a life-threatening complication if not
promptly managed. Early identification and timely initiation of
appropriate antibiotic therapy are crucial for improving outcomes.
However, because blood culture results typically require more than 48
hours, clinicians often face challenges in making timely decisions,
resulting in the overuse or misuse of antibiotics and associated
adverse effects. To address this gap, we developed and externally
validated a multi-institutional machine-learning score that, at the
moment a blood culture is ordered, delivers both the probability of
bloodstream infection and the predicted Gram class of the causative
pathogen.

We extracted 58 structured EHR covariates—age, sex, 11 chronic-disease
flags, and 46 routinely obtained laboratory and vital-sign
variables—from all adult inpatients who underwent blood-culture
testing at Asan Medical Center (AMC) between March 2019 and December
2024 (development cohort, n = 86,802). For model derivation, we
retained encounters with ≤ 5 % missing features, yielding 18,870
culture events (1,305 bacteremia-positive, 17,565 negative); these
were randomly partitioned 4:1 into training and internal-test subsets.
A stacked ensemble comprising gradient-boosted decision trees and a
transformer encoder was optimized to maximize F₁ score for bacteremia
detection. Gram-class prediction was trained on the 1,216
mono-microbial bacteremia cases (835 Gram-negative, 381 Gram-positive;
≤ 3 % missingness) using the same 4:1 split. External validation
employed all blood-culture encounters from Severance Hospital during
March 2022–December 2024 (n = 39,861), with no feature exclusion
except unit harmonization. Models were locked before external
inference; performance was reported as ROC-AUC, sensitivity,
specificity, and calibration metrics for both the AMC hold-out set and
the full Severance cohort.

In the internal hold-out set from AMC, the bacteremia model achieved
an ROC-AUC of 0.854. When applied, without retraining, to the full
external test (Severance) cohort (≤ 25 % feature-missingness, n =
23,189), discrimination remained clinically robust (ROC-AUC = 0.800).
Tightening the inclusion criterion to ≤5 % missingness—thereby
restricting the Severance test set to 6,016 culture events—raised
performance to ROC-AUC of 0.902, confirming that data completeness was
a principal driver of cross-site accuracy. Exploratory stratification
revealed marked differences in baseline comorbidities, which may
account for inter-site differences in predictive performance.

For culture-positive encounters, the Gram-class classifier
distinguished Gram-negative from Gram-positive bacteremia with an
ROC-AUC of 0.802 on the AMC internal test set. At the operating point
selected during training, the model correctly identified 75 % of
Gram-positive cases and 74 % of Gram-negative cases; post-test
probability was strongest for Gram-negative infection, with a
positive-predictive value of 0.87. Permutation-based
feature-importance analysis singled out procalcitonin, erythrocyte
sedimentation rate, and alkaline phosphatase as the highest-impact
covariates, consistent with known pathogen-specific inflammatory
profiles. These results suggest that, once bacteremia is flagged, the
model provides clinically actionable guidance on likely organism
polarity, offering a biologically plausible path to more precise
empiric antibiotic selection.

AB  - Abstract Background Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)
bacteremia is a clinically relevant syndrome with high mortality.
Combination therapy with beta-lactam antibiotics has been employed in
persistent MRSA bacteremia with reported clinical success. Ceftaroline
is a beta-lactam antibiotic with activity against MRSA, which has been
commonly used in combination therapy for this indication. However,
adequate ceftaroline duration after bacteremia clearance continues to
be elucidated. Thus, we aimed to evaluate clinical outcomes of
patients receiving short vs. long duration of ceftaroline after
persistent or high-grade bacteremia clearance. Methods This was a
single-center, retrospective cohort study conducted from January 1,
2014, to June 30, 2021. Patients were included if ≥18 years of age,
with high grade or persistent MRSA bacteremia, who received
combination therapy with ceftaroline. The primary outcome was 30-day
mortality. Secondary outcomes included hospital length of stay, time
to bacteremia clearance, antibiotic-related adverse events and
microbiological relapse. Results A total of 32 patients were included
(mean age: 51.5 years; 71.9% white; 61.3% male). 96.9% had high-grade
MRSA bacteremia and 68.8% had persistent bacteremia. The most common
bacteremia source was bone and joint infections (28.1%). 56.3% of
patients received ceftaroline in combination with vancomycin; mean
duration was 8 days. Multivariable analysis showed increasing the
duration of combination therapy after bacteremia clearance was not
associated with a lower risk of 30-day mortality after controlling for
Charlson comorbidity index and Pitt bacteremia scores (OR 0.75, 95% CI
0.94-2.45; p=0.07). Similarly, no association was observed with
microbiological relapse (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.92-1.16; p=0.73),
antibiotic-related adverse event (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.78-1.10; p=0.75),
time to bacteremia clearance (p=0.88) or hospital length of stay
(p=0.06). Conclusion Longer durations of ceftaroline in combination
therapy after bacteremia clearance was not associated with lower rates
of 30-day mortality, microbiological relapse, or higher rates of
antibiotic-related adverse events. Larger studies are needed to
determine the appropriate duration of combination therapy. Disclosures

AB  - Abstract Background Rapid pathogen identification from positive blood
cultures may help optimize empiric antibiotic therapy quickly by
reducing unnecessary broad spectrum antibiotic use and may improve
patient outcomes. The BioFire® FilmArray® Blood Culture Identification
Panel 1 (BF-FA-BCIP) identifies 24 pathogens directly from positive
blood cultures without subculture. 3 resistance genes are included. We
aimed to compare the time to optimal antibiotic therapy between
BF-FA-BCIP and conventional identification. Methods We performed a
single-center retrospective case-control before-after study of 386
cases (November 2018 to October 2019) with BF-FA-BCIP compared to 414
controls (August 2017 to July 2018) with conventional identification.
The primary study endpoint was the time from blood sampling to
implementation of optimal antimicrobial therapy. Secondary endpoints
were time to effective therapy, length of hospital stay, and
in-hospital and 30-day mortality. Outcomes were assessed using
cause-specific Cox Proportional Hazard models and logistic
regressions. Results We included 800 patients with comparable baseline
characteristics. Main sources of blood stream infection (BSI) were
urinary tract infection and intra-abdominal infection (19.2% vs. 22.0%
and 16.8% vs. 15.7% for case and control groups, respectively).
Overall, 212 positive blood cultures were considered as
contaminations. Identification results were available after a median
of 21.9 hours by the BF-FA-BCIP and 44.3 hours by the conventional
method. Patients with BF-FA-BCIP received the optimal therapy after a
median of 25.5 hours (95%CI 21.0 - 31.2) as compared to 45.7 hours
(95%CI 37.7 - 51.2) in the control group (Figure 1). We found no
effect of the identification method on secondary outcomes.

The vertical dotted lines represent the median time, i.e. the time at
which 50 % of the patients obtained the optimal therapy, for the two
methods. Median (95 % CI) time to optimal therapy is 45.7 (37.7 -
51.4) hours with the Standard method and 25.5 (21.0- 31.2) hours with
Biofire. The tables below the curves present the numbers expecting
optimal therapy according to the bacteria identification method, as
well as the number of censored data in parenthesis. Panel A shows data
from 0 to 900 hours. Panel B shows the data from 0 to 90 hours to
better visualize how the probability to implement optimal therapy
varies in the first 72 hours. Conclusion In conclusion, rapid pathogen
identification by BF-FA-BCIP was associated with an almost 24h earlier
initiation of the optimal antibiotic therapy in BSI. However, the
overall benefit for individual patients seems to be limited. Future
studies should assess the cost-effectiveness and impact on the
prevention of antibiotic resistance using this diagnostic approach.

AB  - Introduction: Blood Stream Infections (BSI) are the second or the
third most common infections acquired in Intensive Care Units (ICU)
following pulmonary infections. Risk factors likely to affect response
to treatment in BSI’s have been investigated in several studies.
However, there have not been any studies in which the predictors of
treatment failures have been evaluated to this extent. Aim: To
investigate the treatment response of patients admitted to the ICU
with acquired BSI cases and the predictors of treatment failures.
Materials and Methods: The study was based on a cohort study design in
which data were collected from all patients with admission to ICU >48
hours during one year. According to the resolution of signs and
symptoms of infection, treatment outcomes (n=70) were stratified into
two cohorts: 1) successful (n=20); and 2) failure (n=50) treatment.
Following risk factors affecting the responses were recorded: source
and severity of bacteraemia; Acute Physiology and Chronic Health
Evaluation II (APACHE II) and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment
(SOFA) scores; isolated pathogens and resistance profile; appropriate
antibiotic initiation; and catheter removal time. Fisher exact tests,
contingency coefficients, t-tests, Mann-Whitney-Utest and logistic
regression analysis was used to examine risk factors associated with
treatment failure predictors. Results: The high levels of APACHE II
detected on the third day of the treatment (OR=1.151) and delayed
appropriate treatment with respect to the onset of bacteraemia
(OR=1.532) were independent risk factors for treatment failure. The
subgroup analyses revealed that other concomitant infections (78%) and
superinfection (40%) were the most frequent reasons in the treatment
failures. Conclusion: Delayed appropriate treatment was found to be
the most crucial independent reason for treatment failure. Besides,
other concomitant infections and superinfection are mostly observed
other significant reasons for treatment failure.

AB  - BACKGROUND

The utility of follow-up blood cultures (FUBC) for gram-negative
bloodstream infections (BSIs) are controversial due to low rates of
positivity. However, recent studies suggest higher rates of positivity
in critically ill patients. The utility of FUBC in gram-negative BSI
in patients with severe burn injuries is unknown.

METHODS

Patients ≥ 18 years old admitted to the US Army Institute of Surgical
Research Burn Center for combat-related thermal burns from
1/2003-6/2014 with a monomicrobial BSI were included. FUBC were
defined as repeat cultures 1-5 days from index BSI. Persistent BSI
(pBSI) was defined as isolation of the same organism from initial and
FUBC. The primary endpoint was all-cause in-hospital mortality in
patients with gram-negative pBSI.

RESULTS

Of 126 patients meeting inclusion criteria with BSI, 53 (42%) had
pBSI. Compared to patients without persistence, patients with pBSI had
more severe burns with median total body surface area (TBSA) burns of
47% ([IQR 34-63] vs. 35.3% [IQR 23.3-56.6], p = 0.02), increased
mortality (38 vs. 11%, p = 0.001) compared to those with
non-persistent BSI. On multivariate analysis, pBSI was associated with
an odds ratio for mortality of 5.3 [95% CI 1.8-15.8, p = 0.003).
Amongst gram-negative pathogens, persistence rates were high and
associated with increased mortality (41% vs. 11%, p = 0.001) compared
to patients without pBSI.

CONCLUSION

In this cohort of military patients with combat-related severe burns,
pBSI was more common than in other hospitalized populations and
associated with increased mortality. Given this high frequency of
persistence in patients with burn injuries and associated mortality,
FUBC are an important diagnostic and prognostic study in this
population.

AB  - Abstract Background Rapid diagnostic testing (RDT) in microbiology
labs shortens the time to identification of bacteria in blood
cultures. This study evaluates the impact of implementation of
Cepheid® GeneXpert® to detect methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus and S. aureus in Gram-positive blood cultures. Methods Patients
with positive blood cultures for Staphylococcus spp. before (November
2015–August 2016) and after (November 2017–8/2018) implementation of a
new rapid diagnostic technology were evaluated. RDT results were
reviewed once daily by the antimicrobial stewardship team. The primary
outcome was time to appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Secondary
outcomes included the duration of antimicrobial therapy from time of
positive culture, duration of vancomycin therapy, and length of
hospital stay (LOS). Results A total of 113 patients were in the pre-
and 73 patients were in the post-implementation cohort. Patients
treated post-RDT demonstrated significantly shorter median time to
appropriate therapy (20.6 hours vs. 49.8 hours, P = 0.03) and
numerically shorter median duration of vancomycin therapy (3.0 days
vs. 1.0 days, P = 0.32). These numerical differences were present
despite the post-RDT cohort having significantly more MSSA and MRSA
infections. Differences in duration of antimicrobial therapy were not
statistically significant. Patients treated pre-RDT demonstrated a
shorter median LOS than those treated post-implementation (7.0 days
vs. 8.5 days, P = 0.03). Conclusion The use of RDT significantly
decreased time to appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Patients in the
post-RDT cohort had longer LOS, which may due to a higher incidence of
S. aureus infections, compared with coagulase-negative Staphylococcus,
in this cohort These results are promising for future RDT
interventions. Disclosures All authors: No reported disclosures.

AB  - The reciprocity between blood cultivation from bacteriemia patients
and related clinical indexes was investigated.Experimental data of
bacteriemia patients collected from Jan.2005 to Jan.2012 in Fourth
Affiliated Hospital of Chinese Medical University were analyzed
through single factor analysis to study the relation between
blood-cultivated bacteria and laboratory indexes,and carried out
Logistic multivariate regression analysis of dangerous factors that
affect the patients' bacteriemia.The results showed that there were
468 cases of bacteriemia patients were brought into the study.Among
264 cases of bacteria-rapid-growth group(TTP≤11.5 h)(TTP,time to
positivity) the occurrence of neutrophilic granulocyte reduced by
31.82%,the occurrence of blood sugar ascension 38.64%,the occurrence
of primary bacteremia 72.73%,the occurrence of ESBL strain producer
31.82%,all of them noticeably higher than those 204 cases of
bacteria-slow-growth group(TTP11.5h)(P0.05).Logistic multivariate
regression analysis indicated that the independent dangerous factors
affected the mortality of in-hospital patients were ESBL strain
production and primary bacteriemia.Therefore,the bacterial growth rate
in blood cultivation was related to neutrophilic granulocyte
reduction,blood sugar ascension,primary bacteremia,and ESBL producing
strain;TTP≤11.5h,and primary bacteriemia and ESBL producing strains
were independent risky factors affected in-hospital patients'
mortality.

AB  - Time to positivity (TTP) is a new parameter in blood culture field.
The article shows us the concepts of TTP, differential time to
positivity (DTTP), and introduces their relation with bloodstream
infection (BSI), catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI).
Besides, it stresses TTP′s clinical application, including determining
the severity of disease; identifying the isolates whether pollution or
not; identification of isolate strains; detection of the drug
resistance of isolates; evaluating the effect of antibiotic; helping
to adjust the therapeutic drug; diagnosing or excluding CRBSI by means
of DTTP; deciding whether the catheter is the source of infection in
patients with candidemia; understanding the epidemiological
distribution of strain. At the same time, the article also describes
the shortcomings and domestic current status. (Chin J Lab Med, 2015,

AB  - OBJECTIVE To analyze the clinical characteristics of patients with
candidemia and to assess the clinical value of the time to
positivity(TTP) of blood cultures in patients of candida bloodstream
infection. METHODS The correlation of TTP with clinical parameters of
82 patients with candidemia was analyzed retrospectively.All
statistical calculations were performed by using SPSS statistical
software. RESULTS The average TTP in patients of C.tropicalis
bloodstream infection was the shortest(17.0±4.9h),C.glabrata was the
longest(43.6±18.9h),C.albicans and C.parapsilosis were(26.6±14.3)h
and(33.7±7.8)h,respectively.Among the clinical parameters of patients
of blood stream infection:78% of patients received long-term
antibiotic therapy and 35% of patients underwent abdominal
surgery.Among the first diagnosis in patients,tumor amounted to the
highest percentage(20.7%) and 35.4% of patients suffered from
respiratory infection at the same time.TTP were no significantly
difference between survival group and death group.In the 30 candidemic
patients with multiple blood cultures,the mortality of the patients
with extended TTP was 16.7%,which was significantly lower than that of
the patients with shortened TTP(66.7%). CONCLUSION More attention
should be paid to the infection of candida for patients rececing
long-term antibiotic therapy,abdominal surgery,or with tumor and
respiratory infection.The change of TTP is related to the prognosis of
the patient.

between MRSA and MSSA were compared statistically. Receiver operating
characteristic( ROC) curve was used to analyze the diagnosis
significance of TTP. Results A total of 101 isolates of SA( 51
isolates of MRSA and 50 isolates of MSSA) and 253 isolates of CoNS
were collected. TTP of SA and CoNS were( 16. 63 ±7. 47) h and( 24. 61
±11.09) h with statistical significance( P 0. 05),and TTP of MRSA and
MSSA were( 18. 22 ±8. 15) h and( 15. 01 ± 6. 40) h with statistical
significance( P 0. 05). ROC curve showed that TTP≤ 16. 90 h was the
cut-off point to differentiate SA and CoNS,and the area under the ROC
curve( AUC) was 0. 758. TTP 12. 58 h was the cut-off point to
differentiate MRSA and MSSA,and the AUC was 0. 630. Conclusions The
accuracy of TTP for predicting SA and CoNS is moderate,and the
accuracy of TTP for predicting MRSA and MSSA is low.

AB  - To assess the characteristics of positive blood cultures in a tertiary
medical center in Japan, 332 positive blood culture episodes were
reviewed from 241 patients at a university hospital in 2012. These
episodes were considered to represent true bacteremia or contamination
at the discretion of the judging panel in the hospital's department of
infection control and prevention. The correlations were examined
between episodes of true bacteremia or contamination, identities of
isolated bacteria, time to positivity (TTP) of blood culture,
underlying medical conditions, catheter placement, and antibiotic
therapies. A total of 244 of 332 positive blood culture episodes
(75.8) represented true bacteremia. Microorganisms frequently found
in true bacteremia were fungus (11/11, 100.0), gram-negative rods
(95/99, 96.0), and Staphylococcus aureus (43/45, 95.6), whereas
coagulase-negative staphylococci (38/93, 40.9) was less common. The
mean TTP of blood cultures representing true bacteremia and
contamination was 22.1 hours and 31.6 hours, respectively. The
diŠerence in TTP for each group was more than 10 hours for
staphylococci and enterococci, although this trend was not observed
for other microorganisms. Antibiotic therapy was administered in 156
of the 175 cases of true bacteremia. Among these cases, antibiotic
therapy was initiated before performing blood culture in 43 cases,
simultaneously with blood culture in 45 cases, after positive blood
culture was reported in 50 cases, and when the identity or antibiotic
susceptibility of the isolated microorganism was reported in 18 cases.
These ˆndings will facilitate the conˆrmation of true bacteremia in
clinical settings, and, in combination with improvements in the
laboratory reporting system, will improve future therapies for
patients with bacteremia. Key wordsblood culture, bacteremia, time

AB  - Introduction: The study objective was to identify independent risk
factors for 28-day mortality in patients who received appropriate
antimicrobial therapy within 1 hour of septic shock recognition.
Hypothesis: Differences exist in treatment modalities, as well as
microbiologic and laboratory parameters, between septic shock patients
who did and did not survive 28 days from septic shock recognition.
Methods: Single-center retrospective cohort study of adult medical ICU
patients with septic shock and microbiologic confirmation of
infection. Included patients received appropriate antimicrobials
within 1 hour of septic shock recognition. Assuming 20% mortality, for
a binary predictor with 50% of patients per category there was 80%
power to detect a 14% difference between groups. Univariable and
multivariable logistic regression were performed to assess independent
associations with mortality. Variables included in multivariable
analysis were determined on the basis of clinical relevance using
forward and stepwise selection. Results: A total 325 patients met
inclusion criteria during the study timeframe. Full compliance with
sepsis bundle resuscitation in the total cohort was 47% with 75
non-survivors at 28 days (23%). Severity of illness was similar
between groups. Microbial isolates were most commonly from blood (57%)
or urine (33%) with E. coli (27%) and S. aureus (22%) the most
frequently identified pathogens. Predictors of mortality by
multivariable analysis included continuous renal replacement therapy
(CRRT [OR 4.48, CI 1.77-11.33; p<0.01]), vasopressor dependence beyond
6 hours of resuscitation (OR 2.56, CI 1.39-4.73; p<0.01) and infection
site other than respiratory, urine, or blood (OR 2.27, CI 1.07-4.79;
p=0.03). E. coli infection and use of piperacillin/tazobactam were
associated with decreased mortality (OR 0.39, CI 0.19-0.83; p=0.01 and
OR 0.53, CI 0.3-0.95; p=0.03, respectively). Conclusions: Independent
predictors of 28-day mortality in septic shock patients receiving
appropriate antibiotics for confirmed infection included CRRT,
vasopressor dependence beyond 6 hours of resuscitation and infection
site. E. coli infection and receipt of piperacillin/tazobactam
significantly decreased mortality in the cohort.

AB  - Objective To evaluate the accuracy of time to positivity(TTP) for
predicting the clinical significance of coagulase negative
Staphylococci(CoNS) in adult blood culture. Methods 130 cases of of
adult hospitalized patients( 16 years) between 2008 and 2012 with CoNS
isolated from blood culture in our hospital were retrospectively
analyzed, divided into bloodstream infection group(81cases)and
contamination group(49 cases). Their TTP difference were compared.
Receiver operator characteristic curve(ROC) was used to analyze TIP,
evaluating that the CoNS was the microorganism of bloodstream
infection or contamination. Results TTP of the two groups were(19.26 ±
7.46) h and(30.72 ± 13.48) h respectively(P 0.001). ROC curve showed
that TTP ≤ 20.88 h was the optimal cut-off point to differentiate
bloodstream infection and contamination, with the area under the
curve(AUC) of 0.836(95% Confidence Interval of 0.761 ~ 0.895),
sensitivity of 72.8% and specificity of 83.7%. Conclusion The accuracy
of TTP for predicting the clinical significance of CoNS in adult blood
culture is moderate, with acceptable sensitivity and specificity, can
be used as an adjunct diagnosis parameter.

AB  - OBJECTIVE To assess the value of application of procalcitonin(PCT)and
time to blood culture positivity(TTP)in the early prognosis of the
severe sepsis patients so as to provide theoretical basis for the
clinical treatment.METHODS The clinical data of 77severe sepsis
patients with positive blood culture were analyzed,and the
distribution of the pathogens was observed;the characteristics of
receiver operating characteristic curve(ROC) were compared between the
PCT and the TTP.RESULTS The gram-negative bacilli were the predominant
pathogens causing severe sepsis,accounting for 74.0%,among which
Escherichia coli was the most common sepsis,accounting for 36.3%.The
median of PCT were 20.04ng/ml and 5.15ng/ml,respectively,the median of
TTP were 10.50hours and 12.91hours,respectively,the determination of
PCT and TTP were significantly statistical between non-survival group
and the survival group(P0.01).The area under ROC curve(AUC)of the
determination of PCT and TTP between non-survival group and the
survival group were 0.870and 0.727,respectively,the asymptotic 95%
Confidence Interval(95%CI)were 0.790～0.950and
0.598～0.856,respectively,the optimal cut off value were 5.25ng/ml and
9.1hours,the sensitivity were 88.5%and 65.4%,the specificity were
76.5% and 74.5%,respectively.CONCLUSION E.coli is the most common
species of pathogens causing the sepsis;the PCT is superior to the TTP
in early prediction of mortality of the severe sepsis patients,with
the accuracy and sensitivity better.Concurrent determination of plasma
PCT and TTP could provide better clinical value in the early prognosis
of the severe sepsis patients.

AB  - Hypothesis: A set of clinical variables available at the bedside can
be used to predict outcome in critically ill patients with bloodstream
infection (BSI). Design: A 3-year retrospective cohort study. Setting:
A surgical intensive care unit in Switzerland. Patients: All patients
with BSI were potentially eligible. Main Outcome Measures: Clinical
variables, organ dysfunctions, and outcome. Results: Among 4530
admissions to the surgical intensive care unit, 224 clinically
significant episodes of BSI were recorded (incidence, 4.9%), with a
28-day fatality of 36%. A total of 110 patients had primary
bacteremia, of which 39 (35%) were catheter related. Although
gram-positive organisms were the most frequently isolated pathogens
(58% [159/275]), they were associated with lower case-fatality (30%)
than BSI due to gram-negative bacteria (44%). Organ dysfunctions
associated with the highest risk of death were neurologic dysfunction
(hazard ratio [HR], 6.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.3-14.5),
hepatic dysfunction (HR, 3.9; 95% Cl, 2.1-7.4), and disseminated
intravascular coagulation (HR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.5-6.1). By multivariate
analysis, 2 independent predictors of mortality were the APACHE II
(Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II) score at onset of
BSI (HR per 1-point increase, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.04-1.12) and the number
of evolving organ dysfunctions (HR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.2-1.7). Appropriate
antimicrobial therapy was associated with improved outcome (HR, 0.4;
95% CI, 0.2-0.6). Conclusions: Bloodstream infection in critically ill
patients is a common and frequently fatal condition. Its outcome can
be predicted by the severity of illness at onset of BSI and the number
of organ dysfunctions evolving thereafter. Appropriate antimicrobial
therapy is an important determinant for survival.

AB  - OF THESIS CLINICAL OUTCOMES ASSOCIATED WITH TIME TO ANTIMICROBIAL
THERAPY CHANGE FROM VANCOMYCIN TO DAPTOMYCIN IN STAPHYLOCOCCAL
BACTEREMIA Background: Staphylococcus aureus is an aerobic, Gram
positive commensal organism that is capable of causing a wide spectrum
of disease. This study contributes to previously published literature
regarding daptomycin versus vancomycin use in S. aureus bacteremia
(SAB). Methods: Adult patients admitted between 2010 and 2014, billed
for ICD-9 code V09.0, 038.11, 038.12, 041.11, or 041.12, and received
vancomycin and daptomycin were included in this retrospective
analysis. Patients were stratified by time to change in antibiotics
from vancomycin to daptomycin to the early switch (1-3 days),
intermediate switch (4-7 days), or late switch (8 days or later)
group. The primary outcome was treatment failure defined as 30-day
recurrence, 60-day all-cause mortality, and 90-day all-cause
readmission. Results: 193 patients were enrolled in the final cohort.
The overall treatment failure rate was 18% with no differences between
early switch, intermediate switch, and late switch (P=0.72) groups.
Independent predictors of treatment success were length of stay
(OR=1.035) and time to positive culture (OR=0.961). Conclusions:
Results of this study did not demonstrate a difference in treatment
failure based on time to switch from vancomycin to daptomycin. Future
research should focus on optimizing use of vancomycin and daptomycin
and medical management of SAB.

AB  - Background Background: Central venous catheter (CVC) removal is
beneficial in patients with CVC-related candidemia, defined as a
higher colony count in a catheter lumen, compared to peripheral blood.
However, clinicians are often faced with a blood culture growing
Candida in a patient with a CVC, and few laboratories perform
quantitative cultures. Therefore, it was proposed that short
time-toculture positivity (TTP) can be suggestive of catheter-related
candidemia, in series of predominantly C. albicans candidemia
episodes. Given the epidemiologic shift to non-albicans Candida
species, and the longer time to detection for C. glabrata, compared to
other Candida species, we studied the clinical characteristics of
patients with CVC-related C. glabrata fungemia and the diagnostic
utility of time-to-reporting (TTR) of positive blood cultures.
Methods: We included patients with ≥1 blood culture(s) positive for C.
glabrata, a CVC and available TTR, seen at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center
between 3/2005-9/2013. CVC-related candidemia was defined as a colony
count in a blood culture obtained via the CVC at least fivefold
greater than the colony count in peripheral blood. Results: Fifty-six
of 115 patients studied (49%) were deemed to have CVC-related
candidemia. Those patients were less likely to be on total parenteral
nutrition (TPN, 34[61%] vs. 48[81%] of those with non-CVC-related
candidemia, P=0.01), or have an absolute neutrophil count <100/μL
(2[4%] vs. 13[22%], P<0.01). TTR was shorter in patients with
CVC-related candidemia (mean ± standard deviation, 67±35 hours)
compared to those with non-CVC-related candidemia (79±31 hours,
P<0.01), and had significant diagnostic value by ROC analysis. A TTR
<48 hours was 99% specific for CVC-related candidemia. Conclusions:
Among patients with C. glabrata fungemia, an abdominal source was more
likely than CVC-related candidemia in severely neutropenic patients
and in those receiving TPN. In the evaluation of patients with C.
glabrata fungemia, a TTR of <48 hours could further support the
decision to remove the CVC.

AB  - Introduction : Several studies have questioned the utility of
obtaining follow-up blood cultures in Gram-negative bacteremia, but
the impact of this practice on clinical outcomes is not fully
understood. Methods : A retrospective cohort study of adult patients
admitted with Gram-negative bacteremia over a two year period, to
compare outcomes in those with and without follow-up blood cultures
obtained. Data collected included demographics, comorbidities and
presumed source of bacteremia. White blood cell count and presence of
fever or hemodynamic compromise on the day of follow-up blood culture
were recorded. The primary objective was to compare 30-day mortality
between the two groups. Secondary objectives included comparing 30-day
readmission rate, hospital length of stay and antibiotics duration.
Results : Of 482 included patients, 321 (66.6%) had follow-up blood
cultures. 96% of follow-up blood cultures were negative. Persistent
bacteremia occurred in 9 patients. There was no signi ﬁ cant
difference in 30-day mortality between those with and without
follow-up blood cultures (2.9% and 2.7% respectively, P > 0.999), and
no difference in 30-day readmission rate (21.4% and 23.4%
respectively, P ¼ 0.704). Patients with follow-up blood cultures had
longer hospital length of stay (7 days vs 5 days, P < 0.001), and
longer mean antibiotic duration (14 days vs 11 days, P < 0.001).
Conclusion : Obtaining follow-up blood cultures in Gram-negative
bacteremia had no impact on 30-day mortality or 30-day readmission
rates. It was associated with longer length of stay and antibiotic
duration. We found this practice to be low yield and its routine use
may be of questionable value.

AB  - Persistent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)
bacteremia despite treatment with vancomycin is not uncommon. Factors
that contribute to vancomycin failure remain poorly understood. A
retrospective case-control study was performed to examine factors
associated with persistent MRSA bacteremia. All episodes of MRSA
bacteremia from 1998 to 2004 were reviewed. Case patients had at least
1 positive blood culture drawn 5 or more days after beginning
vancomycin. Two controls for each case were randomly selected with
negative blood cultures within 48 hours of starting vancomycin. Of 251
MRSA bloodstream infections, 20 patients met the case definition. The
median number of foreign devices, an intravascular device or septic
phlebitis as a site of infection, and a maximum vancomycin minimum
inhibitory concentration of 2 μg/mL were significantly associated with
persistent bacteremia. In a multivariate model, only the number of
foreign devices present at the onset of the bacteremia was found to be
an independent predictor.

AB  - Introduction: Inappropriate initial antimicrobial therapy leads to
higher mortality in patients with bloodstream infection. This study
aimed to evaluate the relationship between risk factors, etiology and
antimicrobial therapy on mortality rates of patients with bloodstream
infection. Methods: Between January 2016 to December 2016, 167
patients with bloodstream infection were prospectively evaluated
according to the presence or absence of inappropriate antimicrobial
therapy of infection. Hospital mortality was the main outcome variable
compared between the two study groups. Results: Infected patients who
received inappropriate antimicrobial therapy had statistically more
diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic
renal disease and death than infected patients who initially received
appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Loading dose error and error in
starting antimicrobial administration were the most frequently
detected error in our study and both were determinant factors related
to increased mortality. Initial antimicrobial therapy was maintained,
escalation and de-escalation 67.6%, 22.7% and 9.6% of cases,
respectively. Coagulase negative staphylococci represented the
majority reaching 40.7% and multi-drug resistant microorganisms were
detected in 27.3% of infections. There was no observed difference in
mortality rates among infections caused by resistant or susceptible
microorganisms. Conclusion: Loading dose error and error in starting
antimicrobial administration, were the most frequently detected error
in our study and both were determinant factors related to increased
mortality. Beside the multiple logistic regression analysis revealed
that the delay in starting antimicrobial therapy was the only
independent factor that increased mortality.
