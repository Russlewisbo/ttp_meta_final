An overall rating was assigned as:\n\n- **Low:** All or most domains low risk\n- **Moderate:** Some domains with moderate risk, no critical flaws\n- **High:** One or more domains with high risk\n- **Critical:** Fundamental methodological flaws\n\n## Overall Risk of Bias Distribution\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Distribution of overall risk of bias ratings across mortality studies included in the meta-analysis.](risk_of_bias_files/figure-html/fig-rob-overall-1.png){#fig-rob-overall width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Summary\n\nOf the 45 mortality studies assessed:\n\n- **12** (27%) had **low** overall risk of bias\n- **30** (67%) had **moderate** overall risk of bias\n- **2** (4%) had **high or critical** overall risk of bias\n\nThe majority of studies had moderate methodological quality, typical for observational prognostic factor research.\n:::\n\n## Domain-Specific Assessment\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Stacked bar chart showing the proportion of studies rated as low, moderate, or high risk for each assessment domain.](risk_of_bias_files/figure-html/fig-rob-domains-1.png){#fig-rob-domains width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Domain-Specific Observations\n\n**Selection:** Most studies used consecutive or clearly defined patient populations from hospital microbiology databases, resulting in generally low risk for selection bias.\n\n**Comparability:** This was the most common source of concern. Many studies reported unadjusted associations, without controlling for important confounders such as patient severity, comorbidities, or antibiotic timing.\n\n**Outcome:** Mortality outcomes were generally well-ascertained through hospital records or national death registries. Persistent bacteremia definitions varied more across studies.\n\n**Statistical Analysis:** Studies varied from simple chi-squared tests to multivariable logistic regression. Studies using adjusted models were preferred in our analysis hierarchy.\n\n**Attrition:** Most studies were retrospective cohorts with complete follow-up data from electronic medical records, resulting in low attrition risk.\n\n**Prognostic Measurement:** All studies used automated blood culture detection systems (BACTEC or BacT/ALERT), providing standardized, objective TTP measurements.\n\n## Impact on Meta-Analysis Results\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n## Risk of Bias Does Not Modify the Association\n\nMeta-regression testing risk of bias as a moderator showed **no significant effect** (β = -0.08, 95% CrI: -0.55 to 0.39). The TTP–mortality association was consistent across studies of different quality levels.\n\nThis provides reassurance that:\n\n1. The pooled estimate is not inflated by low-quality studies\n2. Methodological limitations do not explain the observed association\n3. The finding is robust to study quality variations\n:::\n\n## Sensitivity Analysis: Excluding High-Risk Studies\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table table-striped table-hover\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n<caption>Sensitivity of pooled OR to risk of bias exclusions</caption>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Analysis </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Studies (k) </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Pooled OR </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> 95% CrI </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> All studies </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 33 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 2.14 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 1.69–2.79 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Low + moderate ROB only </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> ~30 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 2.00 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 1.61–2.47 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Low ROB only </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> ~9 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 1.95 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 1.38–2.81 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe pooled estimate remained significant and of similar magnitude even when restricted to low-risk-of-bias studies only, supporting the robustness of the primary finding.\n\n## Limitations\n\nWhile the overall quality profile is encouraging, several methodological concerns are common across the literature:\n\n1. **Retrospective design:** Most studies were retrospective cohorts, limiting control over confounding\n2. **Variable TTP cutpoints:** No standardized threshold exists, making direct comparison challenging\n3. **Limited adjustment:** Many studies reported unadjusted associations\n4. **Single-center designs:** Most studies were from single institutions, potentially limiting generalizability\n5. **Publication bias:** Studies with positive results may be overrepresented (see [Publication Bias](publication_bias.qmd))\n\n---\n\nFor the impact of publication bias on our findings, see [Publication Bias](publication_bias.qmd).
