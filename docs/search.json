The adjusted estimate remained statistically significant, suggesting that even after accounting for potentially missing studies, shorter TTP is associated with increased mortality.\n\n\n4.3 Frequentist Selection Model\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExtreme Adjustment with Sparse Data\n\n\n\nThe frequentist step-function selection model estimated δ = 0.037, meaning non-significant studies had only a 3.7% probability of being observed relative to significant studies. This extreme selection parameter pushed the adjusted OR to 1.09 (95% CI: 0.67–1.79), rendering the association non-significant.\nHowever, this result should be interpreted with caution: with only 3 non-significant studies, the maximum likelihood estimator for δ is unstable and tends toward extreme values.\n\n\n\n\n4.4 Bayesian Selection Models\nTo address the limitations of frequentist selection models with sparse non-significant data, we implemented fully Bayesian step-function selection models in Stan.\nTwo prior specifications for the selection parameter δ:\n\n\n\nBayesian selection model results\n\n\nPrior on δ\nPrior Rationale\nPosterior δ (median)\nAdjusted OR\n95% CrI\n\n\n\n\nUniform(0, 1)\nUninformative — all selection levels equally likely\n0.84\n2.14\n1.70–2.78\n\n\nBeta(2, 5)\nSkeptical — expects moderate selection (mean = 0.29)\n0.50\n2.14\n1.71–2.80\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantKey Finding: Robust to Publication Bias\n\n\n\nBoth Bayesian selection models yielded pooled ORs of ~2.14 with P(OR &gt; 1) = 100%, essentially unchanged from the unadjusted estimate. This occurs because the Bayesian framework:\n\nRegularizes the selection parameter away from extreme values\nPropagates uncertainty about the degree of selection into the pooled estimate\nAvoids overfitting to the sparse non-significant study data",

    "text": "2 Clinical Implications\n\n2.1 For Bedside Clinicians\nShort TTP identifies patients at substantially elevated risk of adverse outcomes. Practical applications include:\n\nEarly risk stratification. Upon receiving a positive blood culture result, clinicians can check the TTP. Patients with TTP below 10–12 hours warrant heightened vigilance and potentially earlier escalation of care.\nMonitoring intensity. Short-TTP patients may benefit from more frequent hemodynamic monitoring, earlier repeat cultures to assess clearance, and closer follow-up for complications.\nTreatment decisions. While TTP alone should not dictate antibiotic choices, it can complement clinical assessment in decisions about source control urgency, the need for combination therapy, or ICU-level care.\nPrognostic communication. TTP provides an objective, easily communicated marker for discussing prognosis with patients, families, and colleagues.\n\n\n\n2.2 For Microbiologists and Laboratory Medicine\n\nReporting practices. Routine reporting of TTP alongside culture results could enhance the clinical utility of blood culture data without additional cost.\nSystem calibration. While the association was consistent across blood culture systems (BACTEC, BacT/ALERT), standardization of how TTP is recorded and communicated would improve its clinical utility.\nCutpoint standardization. Our meta-regression suggests that cutpoints around 10–12 hours may offer the strongest prognostic signal. Laboratories should consider adopting standardized reporting thresholds.\n\n\n\n2.3 For Researchers\n\nCutpoint optimization. The borderline meta-regression trend for TTP cutpoint (β = -0.032/hour, P = 96.1%) indicates that identifying the optimal prognostic threshold is a priority research question.\nPersistent bacteremia. More studies with consistent outcome definitions are needed for this important endpoint. The current evidence (k = 7–9) is suggestive but limited.\nDose-response analyses. Future studies should report both continuous and dichotomized TTP data to enable dose-response modeling and identify nonlinear thresholds.\nConfounding control. Studies should adjust for key confounders including illness severity scores, time to appropriate antibiotics, source control status, and immunosuppression.",

The analysis includes 57 studies with 88 outcome records, representing the largest synthesis of TTP–outcome evidence to date.\nBayesian framework. The use of Bayesian random-effects models with weakly informative priors provides probabilistic statements about the association (e.g., P(OR &gt; 1) = 100%), avoids dichotomous significant/non-significant classifications, and handles small sample sizes more appropriately.\nRigorous effect size hierarchy. The analysis preferentially used adjusted effect estimates and applied clear deduplication rules to avoid double-counting.\nExtensive sensitivity analyses. Results were tested against outlier exclusion, prior sensitivity, risk of bias exclusions, and multiple publication bias adjustment methods (trim-and-fill, frequentist selection, Bayesian selection models).\nPathogen stratification.

The ratio of odds ratios was 1.05 (95% CrI: 0.61–1.83), with only a 57.7% posterior probability of any difference.\nClinical implication: TTP can be used as a prognostic marker immediately upon culture positivity, regardless of Gram stain result.\n\n\n\n\n4.3 S. aureus vs Other Organisms\nStudies focused exclusively on S. aureus bacteremia showed a slightly stronger association (β = 0.12 log-OR), but this difference was not statistically meaningful (95% CrI: -0.38 to 0.62). The TTP signal is not driven by any single pathogen.\n\n\n4.4 Risk of Bias\nStudy quality did not moderate the TTP–mortality association (β = -0.08, 95% CrI: -0.55 to 0.39). This means:\n\nThe effect is not inflated by low-quality studies\nBoth low and moderate-risk studies report similar associations\nThe finding is robust to methodological quality variations\n\n\n\n4.5 Blood Culture System\nDifferent automated blood culture systems (BACTEC, BacT/ALERT, and others) use different detection algorithms, which could theoretically affect TTP measurements. However, the system type did not significantly moderate the association (β = 0.15, 95% CrI: -0.42 to 0.72).\n\n\n4.6 TTP Cutpoint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningBorderline Trend for TTP Cutpoint\n\n\n\nThe TTP cutpoint showed the strongest trend among moderators, with a coefficient of -0.032 log-OR per hour (95% CrI: -0.068 to 0.004). This suggests:\n\nLower cutpoints (e.g., ≤10–12 hours) may capture a stronger signal\nHigher cutpoints (e.g., ≥48 hours) may dilute the prognostic value\nThe posterior probability of a negative slope was 96.1% — suggestive but not conclusive\n\nThis finding has practical implications for future study design: TTP cutpoints of 10–12 hours may optimize prognostic discrimination.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Meta-regression of log-OR against TTP cutpoint (hours).
